Make sure that redis server is installed and must be running while executing the program.

download the folder Files and download the file name News.rb
Make sure that these two are in same directory.

When you start running the ruby program all the xml files get downloaded into the Files folder
For sample I have added few files in the File folder. The files on each Zip folder gets downloaded on their corresponding folder in the File

As there is a huge data in the website it took nearly 45 minutes to complete the execution. When I run the code multiple times the execution terminated saying that memory out of bound.

And you can check the NEWS_XML redis list in the redis server as the whole xml files get stored in the list.
