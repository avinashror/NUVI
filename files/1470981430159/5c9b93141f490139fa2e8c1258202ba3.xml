Boy falls from roller coaster at Pennsylvania amusement park Associated Press | 
LIGONIER, Pa. (AP) — A boy has fallen from a wooden roller coaster at a Pennsylvania amusement park and is hospitalized. 
A spokesman for Idlewild and SoakZone amusement park near Ligonier (lihg-uh-NEER&apos;) says the boy was on the ride with his brother Thursday afternoon when he fell. His age wasn&apos;t released. 
A Westmoreland County emergency dispatcher says the boy was conscious and airlifted to a hospital. 
Park spokesman Jeff Croushore says he can&apos;t say whether the ride malfunctioned. 
Hospital spokesman Marc Lukasiak says he can&apos;t release any information about the boy&apos;s condition. 
The Rollo Coaster opened in 1938 and takes riders up, down and around a wooded hillside. It doesn&apos;t require seat belts. 
The fall comes four days after a 10-year-old boy was decapitated as he rode a waterslide at a Kansas water park.
