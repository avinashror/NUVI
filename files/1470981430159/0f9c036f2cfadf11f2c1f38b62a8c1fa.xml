Summer cold front will bring rain to North Texas The seven-day forecast has a welcome change for North Texas... Rain and cooler temperatures! Colleen Coyle, WFAA 6:04 PM. CDT August 11, 2016 Rain is coming to North Texas this weekend and at the beginning of next week. WFAA Weather CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST 
Some welcomed changes are coming to North Texas this weekend! After hitting the hottest temperatures of the year on Thursday, we get a much deserved break. 
Usually the words &apos;August&apos; and &apos;rain&apos; don&apos;t belong in the same sentence, but that will change Saturday and Sunday. A summer cold front will work its way into North Texas, colliding with a low pressure system moving in from the Gulf of Mexico. 
With these two systems interacting, North Texas will be able to squeeze out some decent rain chances as well as cooler temperatures. 
Rain chances will begin to ramp up across the Red River late Friday night. By Saturday, North Texas can expect scattered (50%) showers and thunderstorms throughout the day with high temperatures in the low 90s. As our front stalls across the DFW area, rain chances continue Sunday. LINK: WFAA radars 
Scattered (60%) showers and thunderstorms expected all day Sunday with even cooler temperatures in the upper 80s. It won&apos;t be raining 24/7, but most areas of North Texas will experience rain before we wave goodbye to the weekend. 
The biggest concerns will be heavy rain causing minor flooding in areas as well as lightning for any outdoor activities. This will be the first decent rain chance North Texas has seen in over 3 weeks! 
Our summer cold front will also finally end our triple-digit streak that began August 1. Want even more good news? Below normal temperatures and rain chances ooze into the beginning of next week!
