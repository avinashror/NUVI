ARAPAHOE COUNTY - A 7-year-old girl drowned Thursday afternoon at a pool at an apartment complex in unincorporated Arapahoe County. 
Deputies don’t believe any adults were present at the time. 
A call was first made about the drowning just after 6:05 p.m. When deputies arrived at the apartment complex at 8828 E. Florida Avenue, they say they pulled the child from the pool and immediately started CPR. 
The girl was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital. 
Authorities don’t know how long the girl was in the water before someone saw her and called 911. 
The 7-year-old’s death remains under investigation.
