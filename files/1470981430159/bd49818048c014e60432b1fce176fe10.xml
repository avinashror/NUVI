Severe drought puts strain on local farmers Lack of rain means farmers have to use city water or drip irrigation Nick Bannin Published: August 11, 2016, 6:04 pm Updated: Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) 
CHICOPEE, Mass. (WWLP) – You could probably have guessed, but there’s been no improvement to our drought. According to the Thursday morning release of the National Drought Monitor, most of western Massachusetts remains in a drought, with many areas in severe drought. Parts of northeastern Massachusetts are even now in Extreme drought! 
Many people who like to shop for locally grown produce are concerned that their favorite fruits and vegetables may not make it to the shelves if the dry weather continues. “Some of the fruit that they grow requires less water,” Roland Archambault said, “but some of it requires a lot of water and those fruits and vegetables are going to suffer a lot.” 
Bill McKinstry is the president of McKinstry Market Garden in Chicopee, where they grow their produce on farms in Chicopee and Hadley. The lack of rain has been tough for them. Because of how dry we’ve been, farmers like McKinstry have had to resort to irrigation, including a type of irrigation called “drip irrigation”: water goes into tubes about 1.5″ down into the ground and just drips water into the vegetables. 
But all that water doesn’t come cheap. “We use the city water which is pretty pricey,” McKinstry said. “But the alternative is you have dried up crops. So we are still getting some yields, it’s just not as good as natural water.” 
Mckinstry told 22News his business absorbs the cost because he doesn’t want to pass the price of water onto his customers. He’s just hoping for rain. More Information:
