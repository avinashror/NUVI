ON SUNDAY morning at Kinross forest around 80 members took on the difficult track. 
Taking off up the hill running machine Mitch Essex (39.27) powered through the field to be the fastest across the 9.1km distance, winning by about four seconds. 
Not far off the pace was Meg Reeves (39.31) as she backed up a great run at Bathurst Park Run on Saturday morning. 
Filling the place positions behind these speedsters were Leanne Corcoran (42.13) and Alicia Ross (47.26) in the womens and David Ross (40.47) and Connor Whiteley (40.54), who finished second and third respectively in the men’s. 
Nathan Sutherland (19.04) glided up and down the hill to comfortably lead home Jack Daintith (22.36) and Jackson Boucher (23.29). 
Again Amber Rich (21.58) dominated the girls’ division over the middle distance as she finished almost a full two minutes in front of Janet Martin (23.29), who came in second ahead of Grace Srzich and Ella Lamrock (25.29) in third and fourth, respectively. 
In the 2km run the young boys smashed it with Lachlan Ross (9.14), Hugh Corcoran (9.36) and Logan Whiteley (10.03) leading the charge. 
For the girls, it was Kate Thornton (11.23) who led the way, with Tanya Connolly (11.36) hot on her heels and Denise Quinlan (17.29) third. 
New club member Danielle Klingberg (53.03), in her sixth run after joining in recent weeks, scorched over the longest distance 9.1km to be the fifth-finishing female out of the 11 competing in that distance, securing the overall handicap winner’s trophy on the day. 
On Saturday a few club members travelled down the road to Bathurst to compete in the second Bathurst Parkrun (5km) and there were some outstanding results with Meg Reeves (19.42) finishing third overall and first female, while just behind her was David Ross (20.49). 
Also running impressive times were youngster Lachlan Ross (22.01) and Marathon machine, Nick Thomas (21.49). 
On Wednesday night the slightly better weather saw a return to the full track with 72 runners and walkers out on the course. 
Mitch Williamson and Connor Whiteley (both 9.44) setting the fastest time, while the very impressive Amber Rich (11.46) powered to the fastest girls time. 
Michelle Pearson (21.34) secured the overall handicap win with a 9 second personal best (PB). 
Other PBs were ran by Greg Pell 17s, Cameron Ross 18s, Greg Shaptor 42s and Adam Sharam 39s. 
Good luck to all of the runners going to participate in the City to Surf in Sydney. Hopefully they are inspired by the Olympic Games and enjoy this great event. 
The club is also on the lookout for volunteers to take the timing gear to the Sunday runs in November and December. 
This Sunday the club run is at Clergate School starting at 9am. Latest News
