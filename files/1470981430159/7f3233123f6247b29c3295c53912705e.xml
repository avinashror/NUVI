DENVER BUSINESS JOURNAL - Denver-based EverWest Real Estate Partners and investment partner WHI Real Estate Partners LP will redevelop an 85,000-square-foot industrial building at 2323 Delgany St. in Denver&apos;s River North neighborhood into an office building. 
Renovations are expected to begin on the project, called The Yard at Denargo Market, later this year, with completion expected in mid-2017. 
(No relation to an apartment complex down the block from the site at 2797 Wewatta Way formerly called Yards at Denargo Market, now called The Marq at RiNo.) 
The move is the latest in Denver for EverWest, which purchased the six-building Panorama Corporate Center in January. EverWest also recently started construction on an office development in Scottsdale, Arizona. 
&quot;The EverWest team is excited to roll our sleeves up on The Yard in Denver,&quot; said Curt Kremer, managing principal with EverWest. &quot;The existing structure offers ultimate flexibility for us as we are designing these interactive common spaces and also delivers an amazing canvas for users who are looking for something different from traditional office space.&quot;
