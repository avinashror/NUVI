Indian tennis ace Sania Mirza feels that there is &quot;enough pressure&quot; on them as elite athletes to even think of aspects like why India is yet to win an Olympic medal till the sixth day of the competitions.

&quot;I don&apos;t feel any extra pressure. I just feel as responsible every time I step on the court, whether at the Olympics or Grand Slam. It&apos;s very tough. If you have to win the tournament you have to win everybody. You have to hope for the best,&quot; Sania said after she and Bopanna won their pre quarter-final match against Australians Sam Stosur and John Peers.

Queried whether the pressure of winning a medal with Indian contingent&apos;s dismal show till now will have an effect, the multiple Grand Slam champion replied:&quot;People follow (Olympics) it every single day and morning. As athletes, we have dealt enough pressure, point after point. We can&apos;t think about other aspects what happened outside. Hopefully it&apos;s going to happen and we are going to win the medal or somebody else,&quot; the world No 1 in WTA doubles ranking said.

It&apos;s her third Olympics and a medal which has eluded her in the two earlier editions means a world to her.

&quot;Personally for me, it would be amazing to win a medal at the Olympics which I don&apos;t have. It would mean the world us. We would do whatever we can and put our best forward,&quot; Sania said.

The Indians are set to meet British pair of Andy Murray and Heather Watson.

About the tough draw ahead, Sania said: &quot;It was a tough match. I&apos;ve been saying this for one year, every match will be tough in the mixed. Playing Grand Slam champions in every round. It&apos;s great to get that win in straight sets. Anything is possible in a super tie-break.

&quot;There&apos;s always room for improvement no matter how good you play. I&apos;m really hard on myself. I want to make every return, every serve and every point count. That&apos;s the way it is.&quot;

In their win in 73 minutes, they had a bit of struggle in the first set when Bopanna could not hold his serve after in between two breaks.

&quot;I obviously feel we both can play better. Rohan played really well today but we both have to play better to win the next match,&quot; she said.

Sania said it&apos;s a big relief to get past the first round as things should fall in place now.

&quot;First round is always tricky because you play against someone who probably don&apos;t play regularly together. You don&apos;t know what to expect.&quot;

Asked whether there&apos;s a lot of pressure on them as India are yet to open their account in medals tally she said:

&quot;We as tennis players, people have been unfair to us saying we play individual sports. I feel we play for our country no matter where we play. We always feel like we play for India,&quot; she concluded.
