Updated: August 12, 2016 10:42 IST Smart Cities board to kick start projects Staff Reporter Tweet The board of the Coimbatore Smart Cities Limited met here on Thursday for the first time to kick start the process of implementing Smart Cities projects. According to sources, the chairman of the board, Commissioner of Municipal Administration, chief executive officer and managing director, Coimbatore Corporation Commissioner, and a few others met and discussed the organisational frame work required for implementing the project. Sources said that the board deliberated on how many posts were required for executing the project and how to fill those posts; the personnel required and their qualification. It also discussed whether it could look for such personnel from within government service and if it had to hire from outside government, how to go about doing it. The second point the board discussed was the setting up of an executive committee comprising officials and the forming of a citizen advisory group. Coimbatore had chosen three major projects under the Central Government project; smart street poles across the city, development of lakes and creation of non-motorised transport corridor around the lakes. As for the creation of non-motorised corridor, the board decided to take up a feasibility study. And for the lakes, it decided to update the proposal at hand. The board also decided to add a Ministry of Urban Development official as its member. It also said it was waiting for the paid-up capital from the Centre and State government. Both would give around Rs. 200 crore.
