Matt LeBlanc: I&apos;m not sure what&apos;s happening with &apos;Top Gear&apos; Associated Press | 
BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) — Matt LeBlanc says he&apos;s not sure whether he will be back for more &quot;Top Gear.&quot; 
Speaking to TV critics Wednesday at an annual summer event, LeBlanc said of returning to the heart-pumping car show, &quot;I don&apos;t know. I&apos;d like to. There&apos;s nothing officially happening yet. Follow the BBC.&quot; 
He said his favorite part about appearing on the series was &quot;probably the travel,&quot; adding that he traveled to places like South Africa, Morocco and Ireland. 
Last month, LeBlanc&apos;s &quot;Top Gear&quot; co-host, Chris Evans, quit the show after a one-season revamped format and a drop in ratings after three previous hosts left the series. 
&quot;That show has a pretty broad demographic. Everybody can relate to an automobile,&quot; said LeBlanc, who is promoting his new CBS sitcom, &quot;Man with a Plan,&quot; which premieres Oct 24. 
He said working on the Showtime single-camera comedy &quot;Episodes&quot; had &quot;wet my appetite, and I wanted to work more. I wanted to be a part of something bigger.&quot; He also said he likes the work schedule of a multicamera show. 
In &quot;Man with a Plan,&quot; LeBlanc plays a dad who cares for his kids after his wife takes a full-time job. 
&quot;This is a new thing, a new character for me, a whole new side of me and I&apos;m looking forward to it,&quot; he said. 
LeBlanc said working on the enormously popular TV sitcom &quot;Friends&quot; made him critical of what&apos;s funny in TV. 
&quot;I&apos;m a joke snob. I don&apos;t love what you call low-hanging fruit. I don&apos;t like that kind of stuff. I tend to go for a smarter joke, and if there&apos;s a discussion about a joke that not everyone will get it, that doesn&apos;t scare me away from the joke. ... I&apos;d rather do jokes that take a little bit of thought.&quot;
