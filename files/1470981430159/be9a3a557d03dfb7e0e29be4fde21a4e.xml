BOSTON (AP) — Red Sox designated hitter David Ortiz wasn’t going to sit out a late-season game against the rival New York Yankees. 
Ortiz left Wednesday night’s game during an at-bat in the ninth inning after fouling a ball off his shin. His status for Thursday’s series finale was uncertain following the Yankees’ 9-4 win over Boston. 
Manager John Farrell said he got a call from Ortiz on Thursday morning and the retiring slugger said he was OK. 
“The way he walked off the field, the way he came off the field last night, it was certainly a question,” Farrell said. “Understands where we are in the season, the standings, the time of the year, the necessity of him being in our lineup. He’s good enough.” 
Ortiz batted third Thursday and hit a ground-rule double in the first inning.
