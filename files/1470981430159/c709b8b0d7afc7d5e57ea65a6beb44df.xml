U.S. men’s rugby eliminated from medal contention NBC Olympics.com Published: Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) 
The U.S. men’s rugby team was eliminated from medal contention after losing to top-seeded Fiji 24-19 on Wednesday. 
To advance to the quarterfinals, the U.S. men’s rugby team needed to win, draw or lose by less than four points. Madison Hughes had an opportunity to kick a conversion to bring the match within three points after Nate Ebner scored a try for the U.S., but he missed wide from a difficult angle. Danny Barrett, who is nicknamed “The Beast,” evaded several defenders to score the first try of the match for the United States. Moments later, Osea Kolinisau responded with a try for Fiji to even the score at 7. Despite being down a man, Fiji scored a try on the final play of the first half to go into halftime leading 12-7. Perry Baker scored a try for the U.S. about 30 seconds into the second half to give the U.S. a 14-12 lead. But once again, Fiji quickly responded to regain the lead at 19-14. Semi Kunatani extended the lead by scoring a try for Fiji, but on the very next play, Ebner scored a try for the U.S. to bring the score to 24-19. It was the second try of the tournament for Ebner, a safety for the New England Patriots who is taking a leave from offseason football workouts to compete at the Olympics. Watch his first try below: The U.S. men’s rugby team will return to the pitch at 3:00 p.m. ET against Brazil, hoping to finish as high as ninth in the final Olympic standings.
