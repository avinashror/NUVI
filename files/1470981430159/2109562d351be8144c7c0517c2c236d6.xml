Beatrice Johnson Memphis
While watching the conventions and the accompanying commentary, one of my mother’s favorite sayings came to mind. She would say, “You’d better know what you’re doing.”
We are considering electing someone to the presidency of the U.S. with all the unbridled power that goes with it, a person who we already know is totally corrupt, a pathological liar, who has no regard for the truth, and no regard for the law.
This person wants to redo the justice system. What does that mean? Could it mean, “I’m going to decide who could be locked up and who shouldn’t”?
Maybe we don’t want to go there. If we do, all I can say is “heaven help us.”
