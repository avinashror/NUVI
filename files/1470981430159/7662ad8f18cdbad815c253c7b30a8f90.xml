NEW YORK (AP)  The deep-fried Twinkie is jumping from the state fair to the home freezer. 
Hostess Brands is launching packaged &quot;Deep Fried Twinkies&quot; starting Friday that mark its first foray into frozen foods. 
The cream-filled snack in vanilla or chocolate is the result of a yearlong collaboration between Hostess and Wal-Mart, as both companies look to spark food sales with innovative products. Hostess says the Twinkie is a bigger business now than even right before the company filed for bankruptcy in 2012. 
For Wal-Mart, it&apos;s part of a strategy of working with suppliers to come up with twists on existing foods or developing new ones. The company, which gets more than half its sales from food, opened a food lab in June as it aims to get products to the shelves faster. Advertisement
