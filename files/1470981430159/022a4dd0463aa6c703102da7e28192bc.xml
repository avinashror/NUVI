Local firefighters finally conquer Mt. Denali summit Tarrant County firefighters take on Denali Todd Unger, WFAA 10:58 PM. CDT August 11, 2016 Clint Brewer and Alex Cramer reached the summit of Mt. Denali on July 4. (Photo: WFAA) 
FORT WORTH -- The days were long, the nights cold, and the outcome far from certain. 
But two Tarrant County firefighters with dreams of conquering North America&apos;s tallest peak have finally succeeded. 
&quot;I&apos;ve done some fun things as a firefighter, but being on top of Denali was a dream come true for me,&quot; Clint Brewer said. 
Brewer, 36, is a Fort Worth firefighter. In late June, he and Arlington firefighter Alex Cramer set off for Mt. Denali in Alaska. 
After months of training lugging around 60-pound backpacks and weights, the two men thought there were ready to ascend a mountain that has alluded so many.

&quot;For me, I was thinking about that,&quot; Brewer said. &quot;I mean, I tried before.&quot; 
In 2014, News 8 documented the journey of a group of local firefighters that spent days trying to reach Denali&apos;s summit. It was ultimately a five-day blizzard that snowed them in at the mountain&apos;s high camp and prevented reaching the peak. 
This time, there was no blizzard.

&quot;The last 30 minutes, you&apos;re just walking up this slight ridge, and you&apos;re walking right to it,&quot; Brewer said. &quot;It&apos;s amazing.&quot; 
For Cramer, who had experience trekking up some of Colorado&apos;s famous 14ers, the experience took climbing to another level. 
&quot;When we got to 17,000 feet, I started feeling nauseous, like I was going to throw up all over the place,&quot; he said, laughing. 
By the time the firefighter brothers were ready to attempt the summit, though, Cramer was well acclimated and ready to go.

&quot;It happened on July 4,&quot; he said. &quot;It was incredible. At some points, there are 3,000 foot drops on this side, 3,000 drops on that side.&quot; 
Both men climbed on behalf of The Warm Place , a local charity that supports grieving children. They helped raise more than $20,000 for the group. 
Brewer says he wants to return to Denali. Cramer says once might be good enough for him. 
&quot;There are other places to try,&quot; he said.
