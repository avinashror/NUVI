There&apos;s no place like home: NBA stars set to play against their former teams in 2016-17 Sporting News 4 hrs ago Nick Birdsong
© (Getty Images) Al Horford, Kevin Durant and Dwight Howard The NBA released its full regular season schedule for the 2016-17 and, as you expect, it&apos;s jam-packed with marquee matchups from Opening Night to Christmas Day all the way into April.
NBA FREE AGENCY TRACKER: Where have all the big free agents gone?
Kevin Durant flipped the script and left the Thunder to join Golden State in the biggest free agent move of the summer. Dwyane Wade chucked the deuces to the Heat after 13 years and headed back to native Chicago. Al Horford took his talents to Boston, and the Hawks picked up hometown hero Dwight Howard. The Knicks added former MVP Derrick Rose to a roster that already included Carmelo Anthony and Latvian sensation Kristaps Porzingis.
We&apos;re sure the fans in Oklahoma City, Miami, Chicago, Atlanta and Houston will have something to say to their former idols upon their return.
Here&apos;s what to expect when each of these stars return to their old stomping grounds.
1. Kevin Durant at OKC © Provided by Sporting News Kevin Durant was spared the brunt of Oklahoma City fans vitriol after he spurned the team he guided to the Western Conference finals for their biggest rivals. Shortly after he held up a Warriors jersey beside Golden State coach Steve Kerr and company, he was off to Brazil to represent Team USA in the Rio Olympics while playing alongside new teammates Draymond Green and Klay Thompson.
DECOURCY: Attacks on Durant range from hollow to hypocritical
Security will be on special alert when the former MVP returns to Chesapeake Energy Arena to take on the Russell Westbrook and the Thunder for the first time Feb. 11. It will be the third of three meetings between the teams. Things will will definitely get a little testy.
2. Dwyane Wade at Miami © Provided by Sporting News Dwyane Wade left South Beach for the windy city of Chicago, but it was more a middle finger to Pat Riley than the Heat faithful.

Never the most rambunctious bunch anyway, Heat fans will likely receive the man who helped bring their team three championships with open arms when he returns to American Airlines Arena on Nov. 10.
It&apos;s still Wade County in the 305.
3. Al Horford at Atlanta © Provided by Sporting News Al Horford might be the second-greatest Hawk behind Dominique Wilkins, but the 6-10, 245-pounder decided he&apos;d had enough when signed with the Celtics, making an up-and-coming squad a possible contender in the Eastern Conference.
MORE: 8 players destined to decline in 2016-17
Typically apathetic Hawks fans will likely let him have it to to some degree when he takes to the court at Philips Arena in the green and white for the first time in his nine-year year career on Jan. 13.
4. Dwight Howard at Houston © Provided by Sporting News The Rockets paired Dwight Howard with scorer du jour James Harden in hopes they might be the next great center-shooting guard combination like Shaquille O&apos;Neal and Kobe Bryant back in the day. However, their personalities and, more importantly, their games didn&apos;t mesh. The Rockets never got beyond the first round of the playoffs together as Howard&apos;s health waned.
MORE: 11 players ready to take over in 2016-17
Houston chose youth and production over age and inconsistency, but this one still be interesting to watch, especially when Harden drives hard to the paint for the first time with Howard looking to protect the rim. The Rockets travel to Atlanta on Feb. 2 for a game that will be aired on TNT.
5. Chandler Parsons at Dallas © Provided by Sporting News Chandler Parsons got in on the Grizzlies spending spree this summer.
MORE: Why the 2017 NBA Draft is going to be awesome
Memphis signed Parsons to a four-year, $94 million deal, then inked point guard Michael Conley to a max five-year, $153 million contract. Parsons and mercurial Mavericks owner Mark Cuban claim to still be friends. However, Parsons made sure he didn&apos;t leave town without a parting shot . He probably wouldn&apos;t mind making it rain on his Cuban&apos;s team in its own building Nov. 18.
6. Bismack Biyombo at Toronto © Provided by Sporting News With Raptors center Jonas Valanciunas injured, Bismack Biyombo made the most of his increased minutes in the playoffs against the Pacers, Heat and Cavaliers.
MORE: NBA Draft grades
The 6-9, 245-pound African led Toronto with 10.3 rebounds and 1.8 blocks per game in the Eastern Conference finals, coming out of nowhere to be a coveted commodity on the free-agent market. He landed himself a lucrative four-year, $72 million deal with the Magic. His matchup against what will hopefully be a healthy Valanciunas in Toronto on Jan. 29 will be a meeting of two grown men in the paint.
7. Derrick Rose and Joakim Noah at Chicago © Provided by Sporting News Derrick Rose and Joakim Noah needed a new start away from Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg, and they&apos;ve both gotten that with the Knicks.
MORE: NBA Draft winners and losers
Rose, a former MVP, is looking for a resurgence int the Big Apple and Noah, a native New Yorker, needs to return to the form that made him an All-Star center and one of the league&apos;s most revered defenders earlier in his career.
Both were staples in Chicago, on the court and in the community, so it will be interesting to see how Bulls fans receive them at the United Center Nov. 4 on ESPN.
8. Rajon Rondo at Sacramento © Provided by Sporting News Rajon Rondo looked like his old self in Sacramento last season after an awful stint in Dallas in 2014-15.
MORE: Most regrettable NBA draft picks in every first-round spot
As a member of the Kings, he averaged a double-double, putting up 11.9 points and league-best 11.7 assists per game. It was just the type of campaign he needed to secure a deal with a with the Bulls. Joining forces with All-Star guard Jimmy Butler and future Hall of Famer Dwyane Wade to form what they&apos;ve referred to as the &quot;3 Alphas,&quot; they&apos;ll likely wipe the floor with the Kings on Feb. 6.
Sacramento fans will be left to wonder what could&apos;ve been, but likely wouldn&apos;t have been had he stayed.
9. Evan Turner at Boston © Provided by Sporting News Evan Turner was solid at best in 2015-16, averaging 10.5 points, 4.9 rebounds and 4.4 assists while helping the Celtics earn the No. 5 seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs.

The Trail Blazers paid him like he was sensational, forking over $70 million to be paid over four years to secure the small forward&apos;s services. Celtics coach Brad Stevens let him walk and decided to select Cal product Jaylen Brown with the No. 3 pick in the draft to help replace Turner&apos;s production.
Boston fans will cordially welcome Turner back to TD Garden on Jan. 21 and let him hear it should the rookie show him up.
