Planned zipline course in Largo concerns residents Largo neighbors don&apos;t want the noise and traffic that would come with a zipline at Highland Park. Beau Zimmer, WTSP 12:31 AM. EST August 12, 2016 “It’s so quiet,” said Cynthia White , who worries about the impact of a ziplining facility in her Largo neighborhood. “My entire pregnancy we walked around the park.” WTSP photo LARGO, Florida — Peace and tranquility is what Cynthia White says she loves most about living across from Largo’s Highland Lake Park “It’s so quiet,” said White. “My entire pregnancy we walked around the park.” But this new mom wonders what life will be like if the city of Largo decides to go forward with a proposed Tree Adventure and Zip line course. The attraction would bring in an estimated 45,000 visitors annually, and with them some worry extra traffic, trash and lots of noise. The course would be built and operated by a private company called Tree Umph which operates a similar attraction in Bradenton. But what neighbors say makes this project different is plopping it in the middle of a public park surrounded by homes. “For the folks that live on 7th and 8th, this is devastating,” said community activist Jean Morris. “This is in their back yard.” “I’ve been ziplining with my wife in Jamaica. It’s a great activity but this is not the place for it,” said Daryl Works who also lives in the neighborhood. He and many other residents are signing a petition asking the city to find a new location for the project. And while the city argues the Highland Recreation Complex has been around for 44 years, neighbors say they’re angry they weren’t properly informed of the possible high-flying changes to come. “It sounds like that’s going to be a blast for people who are coming here … but when you’re living here … and that’s all you hear … all day and all night … it&apos;s not fun. City leaders will get feedback from impacted residents at a public meeting this coming Monday. Planners say they’ll take suggestions into account and plan to make possible tweaks to the proposal including adding additional parking.
