August 12, 2016 Workers heading to Richmond to press for higher wages 
RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Thousands of workers are heading to Virginia&apos;s capital city to push for higher wages. 
The first-ever &quot;Fight for $15 Convention&quot; is being held in Richmond on Friday and Saturday. 
Workers are gathering to press for a $15 minimum wage nationwide. Organizers say the event is expected to draw thousands of low-wage workers from the fast food, retail and farming industries, among others. 
The event kicks off Friday at the Greater Richmond Convention Center with remarks from Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union. 
On Saturday, 10,000 workers are expected to march down Richmond&apos;s Monument Avenue. Dr. William J. Barber III, president of the North Carolina NAACP, will give the keynote address. Category
