Home News Markets Companies Money &amp; Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Luxe Portfolio Catalyst BLink Find Company: Granules India’s Q1 net up 37%; revenue up 7% at ₹344 crore Our Bureau Tweet Hyderabad, August 11: Pharma firm Granules India Ltd’s consolidated net profit increased 37 per cent to ₹39 crore in the first quarter ended June 30, 2016, compared to ₹29 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal. The total revenue grew 7 per cent to ₹344 crore. The company’s board has approved an interim dividend of 20 paise per share of face value of ₹1. “Our topline growth was slightly subdued but we have once again demonstrated our strength in operational excellence with improved bottomline,” CMD Krishna Prasad Chigurupati said in a release issued here on Thursday. Granules Pharmaceuticals, Inc, the US-based wholly-owned subsidiary, recently entered into an agreement to pick up a 12.5 per cent stake in USpharma. “USpharma, in collaboration with its manufacturing partners, has submitted five Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) with Paragraph IV certifications, out of which four ANDAs have already been licensed to us exclusively,” said the CMD. “These are in line with our organisational strategy of solidifying our presence in the US market and enhancing our product portfolio by leveraging both internal and external product development capabilities.” Granules’ scrip lost 3.55 per cent on the BSE on Thursday to end at ₹134.55.
