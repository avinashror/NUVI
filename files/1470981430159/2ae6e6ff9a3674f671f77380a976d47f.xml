US news outlet outs closeted gay athletes competing at Rio Olympics By WWOS staff 43 minutes ago Journalist Nico Hines and news outlet The Daily Beast have come under fire over the article which essentially identified several closeted gay athletes competing at the Rio Olympics (Image: The Daily Beast) Comments 43 minutes ago 
A straight journalist has come under fire for outing closeted gay athletes at the Rio Olympics after tricking them on dating apps. 
US publication The Daily Beast has since deleted the article after heavy criticism on social media. 
Journalist Nico Hines had created a fake profile on dating apps Bumble, Grindr, Jack&apos;d and Rinder in an attempt to see how many gay athletes were using them in the Olympic Village. 
His uploaded story was headlined: &quot;Muscular Athlete for Meets: I Got Three Grindr Dates in an Hour in the Olympic Village&quot;. 
Hines faced further criticism for claiming he didn&apos;t lie to anybody. 
&quot;I didn’t lie to anyone or pretend to be someone I wasn’t —unless you count being on Grindr in the first place — since I’m straight, with a wife and child. I used my own picture (just of my face…) and confessed to being a journalist as soon as anyone asked who I was,&quot; he said. 
Despite not naming them directly, Hines managed to give enough information about the athletes - some of them closeted and competing on behalf of &quot;notoriously homophobic&quot; countries - to identify them. MOST POPULAR
