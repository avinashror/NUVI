GASPÉ, QUÉBEC–(Marketwired – Aug. 9, 2016) – Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions (CED)
The Government of Canada recognizes that innovation-whether it involves the development of new technologies, new processes or new business models-is essential in today’s global economy.
The Honourable Diane Lebouthillier, Minister of National Revenue, on behalf of the Honourable Navdeep Bains, Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development and Minister responsible for CED, announced that the TechnoCentre éolien (TCE) has been awarded $3 million in financial support.
The financial assistance, granted under CED’s Quebec Economic Development Program (QEDP), will enable the organization to continue its efforts at developing products and services and diversifying its markets.
The project targets the structuring of the wind energy industry, innovation and technology transfer in order to boost the performance of Quebec businesses in the sector and ensure their longevity. The TCE intends to continue support the development of this industry and position itself among the leaders regarding wind energy.

“The government I represent firmly believes that Canadians don’t need to choose between protection of environment and economic development, the two can definitely go hand in hand. This is why I’m proud that CED supports the TechnoCentre éolien in its desire to develop and promote the wind energy industry throughout Quebec.”
– The Honourable Diane Lebouthillier, Minister of National Revenue
“The Government of Canada is committed to supporting businesses that develop innovative technologies and processes Canadian economic players need to be more high-performing and competitive. This is why CED did not hesitate to support TechnoCentre éolien in its efforts for creating a state-of-the-art research centre and, thereby, help the wind energy industry in Quebec and the rest of Canada stand out.”
– The Honourable Navdeep Bains, Minister responsible for CED
“TechnoCentre éolien is very pleased to count on financial support from Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions. CED has been a partner of TCE from the outset. Its unwavering support in recent years has enabled us to develop world-class expertise in renewable energy, to conduct research that helps advance science and to partner with a number of businesses in developing and adapting technologies.”
– Frédéric Côté, General Manager of TechnoCentre éolien
