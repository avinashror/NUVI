NOVATO, California (AP) - U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon embraced the 99-year-old woman he calls his &quot;American Mom&quot; on a nostalgic visit to her home where as a high school student from war-ravaged South Korea he spent his first days in the United States in culture shock at the country&apos;s riches. 
Libba Patterson hugged the U.N. chief back on Thursday and later had tears in her eyes when she spoke about how 18-year-old &quot;Ki-moon&quot; became her fourth child and part of her family during his eight-day visit in 1962. 
&quot;To me, today, underneath all the glory and names and what have you that he&apos;s achieved, he&apos;s still Ki-moon, our son,&quot; she said. 
Ban said that month-long U.S. visit shaped his life and responded saying, &quot;Yes, I&apos;m still her kid and she&apos;s still my American mom.&quot; Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.
