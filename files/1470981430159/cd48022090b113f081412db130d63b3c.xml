Realistic Games Launches New Slot “Goal!”   mobile game developer Realistic Games has announced the release of its newest video slot “Goal!”, which is being released just in time for the new football season. Goal! is a 5 reel video slot that has 10 paylines, and includes various football-themed symbols such as balls, shoes, whistles, balls, and more. The game has wild symbols, free spins, and the game can be played via desktops and mobile devices as the game is developed in HTML5 and Flash formats. 
Commenting on the launch Realistic Games CEO Andy Harris said, “The start of the new domestic seasons in Europe felt like a great opportunity for us to launch Goal! and I’m sure both slots and football fans will enjoy playing it. We have found football themes have had universal, cross-territory appeal in recent times, provided they have good maths models behind them, and we’re excited that this one will be a winner too.”
