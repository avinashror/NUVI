Prawit&apos;s security adviser Panitan Wattanayagorn said that defence ministry&apos;s centres for integrated security solutions have instructed local officers to closely watch and put security control over troubled areas. Police authority are also expected to distribute photos of suspects captured from surveillance cameras soon, Panitan said, although not disclosing from which areas the suspects were. It is still soon to conclude who are behind the incidents, he added, &quot;but perpetrators must have ill intentions against development of our country.&quot; But it is likely that the bombs are carried out by a network, given that they exploded in close ranges of time, he said. He also pointed that two inactivated firebombs found in Phuket are new trends that have never been used in earlier southern incidents. People are encouraged to proceed livings as usual, he added, as well as local Mother&apos;s Day ceremonies that should be carried out as scheduled. 591 Viewed
