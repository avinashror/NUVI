Team USA bests India 3-0, stays undefeated Team USA bests India 3-0, stays undefeated NBC Olympics.com Published: Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) 
Team USA is playing its best hockey right now on the world’s biggest stage. 
Behind another stellar effort from Katie Bam, Team USA shut out India 3-0 to stay undefeated in pool play. 
Both teams got out to a sluggish start. It wasn’t until the end of the first quarter that Bam scored the first of her two goals on the first shot of the night for either team. Katelyn Falgowski made a reverse-stick pass to Bam who chipped the ball over a defender’s stick and into the goal. 
From there it was all Team USA. 
Bam scored her fifth goal overall in the tournament after taking an India defender baseline and dribbling back into the center of the circle to wind up for the shot. 
For the second consecutive game, Melissa Gonzalez joined in on the scoring action slamming a powerful shot past India goalkeeper Savita Savita. 
U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs has made a huge impact by staying active and aggressive in the cage all tournament long, and she did the same tonight to earn the shutout win. 
The U.S. is now 4-0 in Pool B and will face Great Britain for a chance to clinch the top spot. Share this:
