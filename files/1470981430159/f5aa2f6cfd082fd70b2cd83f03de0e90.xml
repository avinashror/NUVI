‘Sausage Party’ is a filthy feast – and that’s a good thing. No fruit hangs too low for Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, the masterminds of this grownup cartoon that plays like a big weed-fueled fever dream. It might look like a Pixar film, especially with an opening musical sequence crafted by great Disney composer Alan Menken. But don’t let that fool you. “Sausage Party” is an equal opportunity offender, so make like Rogen’s main character, Frank the Sausage, and bound yourself in a thick casing. No group – women, gays, Jews, Muslims, Mexicans, Indians, etc. – is safe from an easy jab. 
Most of the audience I saw the film with left the theater asking the same question: What was that? The short answer: a foul-mouthed and raunchy “Toy Story” rip-off. The plot doesn’t really matter. But it entails the talking groceries at Shopwell’s market who wish to be bought by one of the gods (shoppers) so they can get to the Great Beyond. Little do they know they could be boiled, sliced, diced, sauteed, chewed up and swallowed. Eating food is murder, and so the groceries revolt. 
Michael Cera voices a deformed sausage who escapes fate, and Woody-style navigates the real world to make it back to the market to warn the others. Kristen Wiig voices Brenda, the bun to Rogen’s sausage. Nick Kroll plays a villainous douche. You read that right. Salma Hayek is Theresa, the sexy lesbian taco. Edward Norton is Sammy the Jewish bagel and David Krumholtz is Lavash the pita bread. Craig Robinson is a box of grits. See where this is going? 
Many of the sight gags and double-entendres are enjoyably dirty. Others are cringe-inducing: talking kernels of corn stuck in poop. Yuck. I can’t unsee it. And the rest ... I can’t even mention most of it in a family newspaper. 
Greg Tiernan and Conrad Vernon direct the script written by Rogen and his longtime collaborator Goldberg. While there are some inspired moments, the second act grows tedious. It’s vulgar just for the hell of it and that brings the movie down. It’s essentially a one-trick pony. But hang on for the grand finale – a full-store orgy. You’ll never look at your groceries the same way again.
