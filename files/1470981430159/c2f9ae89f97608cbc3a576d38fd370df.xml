The preliminary round of the Rio Olympic beach volleyball tournament will come to a close on Day 6. Half the pools have finished group play while the winners of men’s Pools C, D and E as well as women’s Pools A, D and E will be determined today. 
Top-seeded Brazilians Larissa/Talita will kick off the morning session against Poland. Larissa/Talita are 2-0 in group play and are guaranteed to advance to the Round of 16. The Polish women are also 2-0 and will also advance to the elimination phase. 
Cuba’s Diaz/Gonzalez will look to continue their winning streak in men’s Pool D. The pair upset third-seeded Brazilians Pedro Solberg and Evandro in their first preliminary match and bested Latvia 23-21, 19-21, 15-9 to win lead their pool 2-0. 
USA’s Lauren Fendrick and Brooke Sweat will kick off the afternoon session against Russia’s Ukolova/Brilova. The U.S. women need to win this match or face elimination from the Olympic tournament. A win won’t necessarily guarantee them a spot in the Round of 16 but it will give them an opportunity to battle for a final spot in a last chance lucky loser match. 
Phil Dalhausser and Nick Lucena will take on Italy’s Nicolai/Lupo to finish off preliminary play for Pool C. Dalhausser has played the Italian duo before — Nicolai/Lupo defeated Dalhausser and then-partner Todd Rogers in the Round of 16 at the London Games. 
Brazil’s Pedro Solberg/Evandro will follow shortly after, taking on Latvia in the last match of pool play. Pedro Solberg/Evandro are dangerously close to elimination — the pair are down 0-2 and must beat Samoilovs/Smedins if they hope to qualify for a lucky loser match. 
The Round of 16 will be set after Day 6’s preliminary matches come to a close. The elimination round will begin on Aug. 12 at 10:00 a.m. ET. Share this:
