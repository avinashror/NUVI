Taylor Kinney Wants To Get Back Together With Lady Gaga The news comes after the couple recently ended their engagement. Taylor Kinney and Lady Gaga tragically split a couple of weeks ago, ending their 17-month engagement. They had described each other as &apos;soul mates&apos;, but cited work and travel being the reason for the breakup. However, the pair have still been keeping in touch, and a source told US Weekly that they could be back together sooner than we expected. “Taylor really hopes they’ll get back together.” they said. The source added that Lady Gaga is busy working on her sixth studio album, while Taylor Kinney is working on a new NBC show. “There is absolutely still a chance they can get back together,” they said. “She still feels terrible and hopes it can work out.” Lady Gaga wrote a heartwarming tribute on Instagram when they announced their split. She wrote: &quot;Taylor and I have always believed we are soulmates. Just like all couples we have ups and downs, and we have been taking a break. We are both ambitious artists, hoping to work through long-distance and complicated schedules to continue the simple love we have always shared. Please root us on,” Gaga continued. “We’re just like everybody else and we really love each other.” Jul 19, 2016 at 9:05pm PDT Don&apos;t Miss
