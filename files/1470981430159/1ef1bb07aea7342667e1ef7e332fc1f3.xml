Barron Lighting Group introduces the Surf and Wave, two exciting new commercial linear flex products from the specialtyLED brand. 
The SURF is an economical, commercial grade solution for your LED architectural accent lighting needs. By providing optics within the Eco-friendly UV Resistant flexible PVC housing, the SMD5050 LEDs far exceed the output of standard ribbon flex and deliver the highest performance (274lm/ft) available on the market today. 
With its slim profile that allows indirect installation in tight spaces, the Surf is perfect for use in cove lighting, borders, bridges, gazebos, signage, and even marina or fountain applications with its optional IP68 submersible rating. The Surf is highly efficient at only 3.6w/ft or less, and is dimmable with 0-10V dimming drivers. The SURF can be installed as a solid run up to 65’ for large indoor or outdoor commercial jobs, with either IP65 or IP68 rating. For design flexibility, SURF is available in four white color temperatures, as well as amber, blue, green, red and RGB. 
The Wave is the latest architectural flexible border tube offering additional flexibility to your creative designs with its back-to-front bending orientation. Corners and angles can now be installed seamlessly due to its flexible PVC housing that is virtually indestructible. 
The Wave’s flexible PVC housing can conform to almost any angle and is virtually unbreakable. It is available in red, blue, green and several color temperatures of white as well as RGB. This energy efficient LED product consumes 3.4W/ft or less, saving up to 70% or more over traditional neon with uniform lighting and no “hotspots”. The Wave is indoor and outdoor IP68 rated and salt, fog and chlorine tested.
