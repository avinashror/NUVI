Shade, water breaks helping people beat the heat Sy Becker Published: August 11, 2016, 6:05 pm Updated: Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Staff and volunteers from the Community Survival Center in Indian Orchard enjoy a picnic in the shade at Chicopee Memorial State Park 
SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (WWLP) – When you’re helping rebuild a vital neighborhood in the city of Springfield, there is no time off, regardless of the heat. Northern Construction employee T.J. O’Dell is one of the people replacing a water line at Main and Union Streets, in the heart of MGM’s resort casino construction site. 
O’Dell, a resident of the Worcester County town of Barre, told 22News that you get accustomed to the heat. However, there are those humid days when conditions become unbearable- such as when the temperature tops 100 degrees, or at least feels like it. 
“Some days, I mean it is hot. You work a lot, and it makes the day a little miserable,” O’Dell said. “The water keeps you going.” 
It was just a stroke of good timing that Jackie Madden picked this hot day to treat her volunteers from the Community Survival Center in Indian Orchard to a picnic at Chicopee Memorial State Park. The tall trees provided the shade protecting dozens of picknickers from the oppressive heat. 
“Nice day, breeze; couldn’t be better in the state park, Chicopee State Park,” Madden said. “All our volunteers and the staff that work so hard during the year, it’s a thank you for them.” 
While the humidity helped make it feel like it was more than 90 degrees, it was feeling considerably more comfortable in the shade. Share this:
