A-Rod has RBI in Fenway finale, Yankees beat Red Sox WCSH 9:50 PM. EST August 11, 2016 Aug 11, 2016; Boston, MA, USA; New York Yankees designated hitter Alex Rodriguez (13) signs a bat for Jacob Doherty of Wilmington, MA (left) after a game against the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park. Mandatory Credit: Mark L. Baer-USA TODAY Sports (Photo: Mark L. Baer, Mark L. Baer)   BOSTON (AP) - Alex Rodriguez drove in a run with a bases-loaded dribbler, capping a three-run rally in the eighth inning that lifted the New York Yankees over the Red Sox 4-2 Thursday night and sent the booed designated hitter out of Boston with one last victory. Rodriguez is set to play his final game for the Yankees on Friday night at home against Tampa Bay. The 41-year-old designated hitter will then be released and become an adviser and instructor for the club. Rodriguez was 0 for 4 and loudly jeered throughout the game, which turned in the Yankees&apos; favor on a crucial fielding mistake that allowed them to overcome a 2-1 deficit and take two out of three in the series. Rodriguez lined out, popped out and struck out before his tapper in front of the plate in the eighth allowed Brett Gardner to score from third and put New York up 4-2. In 1994, Rodriguez was a teenager with Seattle when he got an infield single at Fenway Park for his first major league hit.
