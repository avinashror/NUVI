Five Just Wasn’t Enough 
The Netherlands gripped on to 2-1 victory despite India having five chances in a row to tie it up at the end of the game. 
With six seconds remaining, India earned a penalty corner that just fell short of the goal. As they played through the time left on the clock, they received one more penalty corner chance to tie it up, which actually ended up turning into four opportunities. 
India could not capitalize on any of these, despite doing so earlier in the game thanks to Raghunath Vokkaliga’s drag flick. The Dutch finally claimed victory, which for them meant for now claiming the top spot in the standings ahead of Germany. 
Mink Van der Weerden continued his Olympic success by scoring the goal that put the Dutch ahead in the fourth quarter. 
India is still very much in contention in Pool B coming in currently at the third spot. Share this:
