AGAWAM, Mass. (WWLP) – A thunderstorm that brought about a Severe Thunderstorm Warning for south-central portions of Hampden County has moved into Connecticut. 
The warning was in effect until 2:45 P.M. for Agawam, Southwick, Longmeadow, East Longmeadow, and Hampden, as well as the towns on the Connecticut side of the state line, such as Enfield, Suffield, and Somers. 
The storm continues to move to the southeast, and the warning area has shifted into Hartford’s eastern suburbs. 
If a Severe Thunderstorm Warning is issued, that means that severe weather is already taking place. Take shelter indoors on the lowest floor possible. More Information:
