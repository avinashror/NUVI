A 62-year-old mother is facing homicide charges after her 15-day-old daughter died after being beaten by her 6-year-old brother, Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said Thursday. 
Kathleen Marie Steele has been charged with aggravated manslaughter. 
On Monday, Steele left the baby, also named Kathleen, in a vehicle with her two siblings while she went into a cell phone repair store. While she was inside the store the infant started crying, Gualtieri said. 
The 6-year-old brother picked up the baby and dropped her on the floor of the vehicle, then &quot;slammed&quot; her around the vehicle, the sheriff said. 
The boy later admitted to investigators what he had done, said Gualtieri, who added he thought the child was imitating what he had seen his mother do to calm the baby. 
Gualtieri said the baby&apos;s skull was cracked and probably died in the vehicle. 
Steele left the children in the vehicle by themselves for more than a half hour, he said. After leaving the store, Steele drove to Enterprise Rent-A-Car and spent another half hour there before returning home, the sheriff said. 
When the family returned home, Steele called a neighbor who was a nurse to look at the child. The neighbor recognized the infant was dead, but called 911. The child was taken to St. Petersburg General Hospital, where she was declared dead. 
Gualtieri said Steele was &quot;blase&quot; while discussing the child&apos;s death, saying at one point, &quot;I guess I have to plan a funeral.&quot; 
Because of the child&apos;s age, the boy will not face criminal charges, Gualtieri said. 
Steele was under investigation by the Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office Child Protection Investigation Division at the time. Florida Department of Children and Families Secretary Mike Carroll said his department had no prior involvement with the family. 
Baby Kathleen was conceived using frozen sperm from Steele&apos;s late husband, who passed away in September 2011, Gualtieri said.
