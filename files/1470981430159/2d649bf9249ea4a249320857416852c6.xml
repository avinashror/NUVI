OLIVIA, Minn. - Strong storm systems that rolled across Minnesota Wednesday night into Thursday morning left a number of communities under water. 
Residents of Kandiyohi and Renville Counties saw official rain totals that topped eight inches, although radar indicates that some may have received as much as 10 inches. Streets were flooded and impassable, basements filled with water, and the Kandiyohi County Fairgrounds are swamped.

The city administrator in Olivia says at least 100 homes have been impacted by flood-related damage. Pictures shared by KARE 11&apos;s Ivory Hecker show impassable intersections, and a park that resembles a lake.

Areas of southeastern Minnesota and western Wisconsin didn&apos;t fare much better. Rain pounded communities in Wabasha County, and across the river in Trempealeau and Buffalo Counties, triggering flash flood warnings that will continue through the day. In Wabasha County rains triggered a mudslide that closed Highway 61 until crews could complete cleanup. Models show the area received nearly eight inches of rain.

The forecast isn&apos;t all that promising either. After drying out for the late morning and midday hours, there are chances that storms could redevelop, bringing more rain to areas that don&apos;t need any more.
