Germany’s Barbara Engleder wins 50m rifle 3 position event Germany&apos;s Barbara Engleder wins 50m rifle 3 position event NBC Olympics.com Published: Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) 
Germany’s Barbara Engleder earns her first ever medal by winning gold in the women’s 50m rifle 3 position competition. The world number five ranked shooter is the second German to win gold in the discipline. 
The 50m rifle 3 position event consists of firing while kneeling, prone (laying on stomach) and standing, in that order. The 33-year-old German shooter led the way at the end of prone, and was at or near the top of the leaderboard for all of the standing shots. 
Engleder, who finished sixth in the event in the London 2012 Games, almost coughed up the gold medal on the final shot, only scoring a 9.0 as China’s silver medalist Binbin Zhang fired a 10.4. Still, she had accumulated a large enough cushion where her lead was safe. 
When Engleder realized she had won, she dropped down to her knees and screamed with excitement to the crowd. 
Zhang, 27, was in sixth after the prone position, but began to ascend the leaderboard in the final phase of the competition. This is her first medal in a major international competition. 
Du Li, also representing China, was ahead of Zhang with one shot to go before the bronze medal exit. She missed her mark by firing an 8.6 to miss out on the chance for gold, earning her second bronze medal of Rio, as she placed in 10m air rifle as well. 
China now has six shooting medals in the Rio Games. 
Ginny Thrasher, the U.S. Olympic debutant who won the 10m air rifle gold medal, was eliminated in qualifications. 
The final standings are as follows: 1. Barbara Engleder (Germany)
