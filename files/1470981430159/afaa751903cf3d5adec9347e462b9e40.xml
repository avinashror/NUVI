Raju Murugan, who struck gold with his debut movie &quot;Cuckoo,&quot; is back with his second outing &quot;Joker.&quot; While his first film was a romantic drama, the latest flick is a political satire in which Guru Somasundaram of &quot;Jigarthanda&quot; fame plays the lead role. 
Joker Movie Review 
Ramya Pandian is doing the female lead role in the movie, which has Gayathri Krishna, Ramasamy, Bava Chelladurai and others in the cast. Sean Soldan is the music director of &quot;Joker&quot; and his four songs like &quot;Ennanga Sir Unga Sattam,&quot; &quot;Ola Ola Kudisayila,&quot; &quot;Jasmine –U&quot; and &quot;Mannar Mannan Theme&quot; have turned out to be chartbusters. Chezhiyan is the cinematographer and Shanmugam Velusamy is the editor of the Tamil flick. 
&quot;Joker&quot; attempts to highlight the current societal issues and projects the political situation of the country. The story is being narrated from the view of a 40-year old man. Guru Somasundaram plays the role of Mannar Mannan, who works in a water company. His simple questions about politics are presented in humorous way. 
Despite being a hard-hitting and message-oriented flick, &quot;Joker&quot; entertains the viewers with lots of comedy and leaves the audience wondering why they cannot dismiss a government if they have the power to elect it. 
Review: The movie has garnered good response for its trailer and audio. The audience hope that it will live up to their expectations. Find what they think about the movie below:
