After beating Tan in a competitive opening first game 21-17, Wang lost the next game 22-20. It was exceptional match as it went right down to the wire with Tan pulling out a 22-20 victory. In game three, Wang was super impressive, showing skill, determination, and poise to stay calm under pressure and hold the lead that she had built. The Pasadena native won game three 21-14, the match 2-1, and gave Team USA Badminton a much needed jolt after two losses earlier in the day.
