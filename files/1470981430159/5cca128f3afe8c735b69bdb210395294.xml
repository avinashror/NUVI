Folk in the Town at weekend Sharon Clifton sings with The Fried Pirates ANL-160908-170048001 06:45   
Lynn will enjoy a two-day festival of folk in the Tuesday Market Place tomorrow and on Sunday as Folk in the Town is held. 
Organised by West Norfolk Council, Folk in the Town is a brand new event, where 11 folk artists will perform across two days of live, free music, from noon until 6pm. 
Elizabeth Nockolds, borough council cabinet member for culture, heritage and health, said: “If you’re a fan of folk, roots and acoustic music, you’ll know that we’ve got a fantastic lineup of talented local musicians. 
“If you’re not a fan, come along and give the acts a listen, and you soon will be! 
“Folk in the Town is a great addition to our events programme; two fun, free, relaxing days out for all the family. Tuesday Market Place will be transformed with a rustic, hay bale-strewn marquee for this mini-festival, and we want everyone to join in. 
“Get yourself a drink from the bar, pull up a chair (or a hay bale!) and tap a toe to some great music”. 
Adrian Tebbutt, from The Fried Pirates, added: “It has been fantastic working with the borough council to set up this event. 
“ The local acoustic scene is thriving and we have some of the best local bands and musicians playing a wide variety of songs ranging from traditional and modern English folk, through Americana, to outstanding original material. 
“It is a great opportunity to hear music you may not have encountered before, so please drop in, listen, and be prepared to stay for the whole afternoon!” 
The acts performing tomorrow, noon to 6pm, are: Isabella, The Fried Pirates, Joe &amp; Mary, Longshore Drift, Wolfswood, The Tildens. 
Also performing on Saturday will be Aria’s Echo, a talented acoustic duo. 
They will be busking in the Vancouver Quarter, pointing visitors to the full event on the Tuesday Market Place. 
On Sunday, noon to 6pm, are: Mike Prior, Gamorra, Kelly Pritchard &amp; Kev Walford, The Fried Pirates, Waterline, The Macarnos.
