CBC announcer gets Phelps, Lochte mixed up during 200m IM final The Olympics begin August 5th. Alec McQuade, WXIA 11:35 PM. EDT August 11, 2016 USA&apos;s Michael Phelps (L) and USA&apos;s Ryan Lochte celebrate on the podium after they won the Men&apos;s 4x200m Freestyle Relay Final during the Rio 2016 Olympic Games at the Olympic Aquatics Stadium on August 9, 2016.

First, let me say we all make mistakes. 
I just had to delete a Tweet because I forgot one word that made it horribly inaccurate. We always strive for accuracy, but when writing non-stop for about 12 hours a day, you&apos;re going to make mistakes. 
I&apos;m sure the announcers at the CBC strive for accuracy, but they really messed this one up. 
During their broadcast of the men&apos;s 200m individual medley that featured the final showdown between Ryan Lochte and Michael Phelps, CBC announcer Elliotte Friedman got his lanes mixed up. That led to him thinking Michael Phelps was Ryan Lochte and Ryan Lochte was Michael Phelps. 
So in the final 50 meters of the race, Friedman was proclaiming a major upset. 
&quot;Lochte is going for it...and Phelps doesn&apos;t look like he has this one in him. Lochte going to win his 13th career medal!&quot; 
Meanwhile, it is really Phelps pulling away. 
&quot;Ryan Lochte is going to beat Michael Phelps...Phelps might not even make the podium!&quot; 
Right as Friedman said that, Phelps name came up as the winner. Oops. CBC announcer calls entire Olympic event as though Ryan Lochte is winning instead of Michael Phelps. Oh, Canada. pic.twitter.com/ldae5E4sCQ — (((Yair Rosenberg))) (@Yair_Rosenberg) August 12, 2016 I&apos;m sorry everyone. I blew it. No excuses — Elliotte Friedman (@FriedgeHNIC) August 12, 2016 
After the race, Friedman Tweeted an apology. 
&quot;I&apos;m sorry everyone. I blew it. No excuses.&quot; 
Except he&apos;s probably been working 20-hour days and getting little sleep. So, we&apos;ll cut him some slack.
