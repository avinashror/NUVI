HOUSTON – The Astros have unveiled their plans on what’s next for Tal’s Hill. 
The team will renovate center field, which includes removing the well-known mound, and replacing it with new seats and food and beverage areas, the team announced Thursday. The Astros will begin construction on the new center field at the end of the season. Team officials say the renovated center field will be ready by the start of the 2017 season. 
“This project is our latest effort to make Minute Maid Park one of the most modern and comfortable venues in Houston,” said Astros President of Business Operations Reid Ryan.

With the removal of Tal’s Hill, the center field wall will be pushed in from 436 feet to 409 feet. 
The renovations include field-level seating, four food locations and three bar locations. 
The Astros said they used feedback from fans, current and former players and front officer personnel to develop the new design. Team executives also visited other MLB ballparks for ideas.
