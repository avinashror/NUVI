by Arno Maierbrugger - Aug 12, 2016 A series of coordinated bomb explosions across Thailand has targeted tourist towns, leaving four dead and injuring more than 30 people, including foreigners, with reports of more explosions coming in by the minute. 
In less than 24 hours, bombs attacks were launched in Trang, Hua Hin, Surat Thani and Phuket. 
One was killed and six others were injured in the explosion at the Center Point shopping mall in Trang at 3pm on August 11. 
Then, two explosions hit the Hua Hin town late at night on the same day, killing a Thai woman and injuring 21 Thai and foreign tourists. 
At 8:02am on August 12, two explosions occurred in front of the marine police station and Mueang Surat Thani police station, killing one person and injuring many other. Nearly at the same time, one was injured in an explosion on Patong beach in Phuket. Police safely disposed another bomb at the Loma beach. 
Then at 9am, two more explosions reportedly occurred at the clock tower in Hua Hin.
