Originally from Penn, ND, Raymond passed away in Elbert CO after a valiant battle against cancer. He was born November 1, 1945, in Devils Lake ND, to Edgar Geahart and Steinunn Solveig Kaeding. He attended elementary school in Penn, graduating from Devils Lake Central High. His favorite sports team remained the Satans. Raymond lived life to the fullest and thoroughly enjoyed and thrived on his farm, family, neighbors, friends and community. He will be missed and would want us to take a trip down memory lane, pull up a few favorites and have a chuckle. Raymond was preceded in death by his parents. This great man will be cherished forever by his daughters, Shannon (Kurt) and Melissa (Pat); his grandchildren, Jade, Jillian and Jack; his brother, Duane and sister, Mardell; his nephews, Darrell and David and niece, Carla; his ex-wives, Sharon and Billie and all his extended family. As per his wishes, there will be no services. An interment will be October 15 at 3 p.m. at the Penn Cemetery. Following will be a final toast to Raymond at the Penn Bar. And all God&apos;s people said Amen!
