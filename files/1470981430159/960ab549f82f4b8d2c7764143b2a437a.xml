The former St John Fishers School flew out to the United States in 2012 to play at Hofstra University, where she broke the university&apos;s all-time goalscoring record. 
She has also represented England at U17 and U19 level and was a key part of the Under-23s squad at the La Manga Tournament in March. 
Houston Dash striker Daly scored on her England debut in June, netting the third goal in a 7-0 victory over Serbia. 
The 24-year-old has twice been nominated for the Goal of the Week prize in the NWSL since joining Dash, where she has found the net four times in 12 appearances. 
The Lionesses will meet at St George’s Park on Sunday, where they will stay for five days, before moving to Bisham Abbey on Thursday, August 18 for two days. 
The camp will form the start of England’s preparations for next summer’s UEFA Women’s Euros. Rachel Daly scored on her England debut against Serbia
