CAVALIERS have enjoyed stunning success since their establishment in Orange District Cricket Association in 1980, and the club is calling on all current and former players to unite in October to celebrate the maroons’ 35 th anniversary. 
In that 35 years the club has won a combined 34 titles across seven grades and competition, and eight club championships to boot. 
Remarkably 29 of those titles have come in the ODCA’s top grade and former Bathurst-Orange Inter-District Cricket Association (BOIDC), 13 in red-ball cricket and 16 in the now-named Royal Hotel Cup. 
Those 13 long-form titles included the club’s eight consecutive trophies between 2002-03 and 2009-10 – an unmatched mark since the association’s birth in 1911-12. 
Cavaliers have also won a combined five lower grade and colts titles. 
The maroons will celebrate that success on Saturday and Sunday, October 1 and 2 with some T20 matches and a formal dinner on the Saturday before a social, nine-hole two-person ambrose on the Sunday at Wentworth Golf Club 
The dinner will include guest speakers, captains from the 1980s, 90s and 2000s along with reports on special players and happenings relating to those eras. 
Organisers are strongly focused on identifying as many players as possible who have donned the famous maroon club colours to ensure they can claim a spot in any of the planned activities. 
For more information and to drop in the names of remembered players, contact life member Guy Ruddy (0404034 339, colleenandguy@bigpond.com) or vice president Mike Middleton (0418435 250, mikem@middwest.net) before Friday, August 26. Latest News
