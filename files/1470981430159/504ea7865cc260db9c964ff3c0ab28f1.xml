NEW YORK (AP) -- Rowdy Gaines clearly had much to say as Michael Phelps turned the race for his 22nd Olympic gold medal into a rout on Thursday. We&amp;apos;re just not sure what it was.
The NBC swimming analyst&amp;apos;s voice turned into a high-pitched shout that became lost in the roar of the crowd. There&amp;apos;s nothing wrong with an announcer reflecting an event&amp;apos;s excitement, but not to the point of losing control. Better to take a breath.
Only hours earlier, the knowledgeable Gaines showed what he had to offer. In the relative calm of an 800-meter freestyle preliminary race in the afternoon, Gaines neatly broke down gold medalist Katie Ledecky&amp;apos;s swimming style in illuminating fashion, explaining to non-experts what put her ahead of her rivals.
&quot;This is the only time I get to talk about her stroke,&quot; Gaines said. &quot;She&amp;apos;s so fast in the 400.&quot;
Swimming analyst Michele Tafoya was impressive in leading Simone Manuel into speaking with emotion and a sense of history after becoming the first African-American woman to win a gold medal in swimming.
The best part of NBC&amp;apos;s swimming coverage - no, not the silly count-up clock marking the minutes between Phelps&amp;apos; race time - was the decision to televise the ceremony after Phelps won the 200-meter individual medley for the fourth consecutive Olympics. His eyes glistening, Phelps struggled to control his emotions as the national anthem played.
&quot;Even for the 22nd time, it never gets old,&quot; NBC&amp;apos;s Dan Hicks said.
FIJI GOLD: It was a joy to watch the Pacific Island nation of Fiji win its first Olympic medal, striking gold by routing Britain in the rugby sevens final, and a great example of the benefits to searching beyond NBC&amp;apos;s prime-time coverage to see all that is being offered. &quot;It&amp;apos;s hard to put into words how big icons these players will be,&quot; NBC announcer Bill Seward said. &quot;Being gold medalists, they will be heroes in their country forevermore.&quot;
The win produced an outpouring of celebrations in the stands and by players after the match. The sport is huge in Fiji, and the nation&amp;apos;s prime minister traveled to Brazil for the games.
SIMONE&amp;apos;S GOLD: &quot;That is dominance,&quot; said NBC&amp;apos;s Al Trautwig, explaining that gymnast Simone Biles&amp;apos; margin of victory was larger than the last nine all-around women gold medalists combined.
DVR ALERT: Let&amp;apos;s hope mom and dad pressed the &quot;record&quot; button for any young aspiring gymnasts who wanted to see Biles&amp;apos; win. After starting its broadcast showing half the competition, it was a long wait until the second half.
RATINGS: NBC reached 26.4 million people with its Wednesday prime-time telecast, dominated by swimming and beach volleyball. Add in streaming and the 1.9 million people who watched the U.S.-Australia basketball game on NBCSN, and there was a total of 28.6 million consuming Olympic content. During the corresponding night in London, NBC had 30.8 million viewers.
FORE: NBC has clearly not been happy with the golfers who chose to stay away from Rio de Janeiro, making the Olympics&amp;apos; first golf competition a little less star-studded than expected. Jordan Spieth, Jason Day, Rory McIlroy and Dustin Johnson cited concerns about the Zika virus; some critics have suggested concerns about a lack of prize money were in the mix, too. NBC host Mike Tirico said Thursday they were missing the chance to increase their sport&amp;apos;s popularity worldwide. &quot;I&amp;apos;m a believer that golf needs the Olympics more than the Olympics need golf,&quot; he said.
