BU men&apos;s soccer brings youthful experience in 2016 
By WBNG Sports   11:49 PM EDT 
VESTAL, NY (WBNG) - The Binghamton University men&apos;s soccer team reached the America East championship game in 2015 for the first time since 2008. The Bearcats fell short and had to watch Vermont raise the trophy. Now as fall practices begins, BU is ready for even more success in 2016. 
Just like most college programs BU lost a couple key contributors from the 2015 team, including two first team all-conference selections. However, the Bearcats also return much of its starting lineup including two all-rookie selections. Head coach Paul Marco says youth isn&apos;t necessarily a bad thing.

&quot;This is the youngest team I have had in my 20 years of being a head coach,&quot; said Marco. &quot;We have a lot of freshman and sophomores on the team. The great news is that a lot of those sophomores played significant minutes last year. So the growth of the team has been quite good. The spirit of the team, it&apos;s early right now, but it&apos;s been terrific. The enthusiasm in which the guys have gone out on the field, and even when we have been doing our fitness tests, has been great.&quot; 
&quot;Young teams,&quot; said senior Zach Galluzzo. &quot;They have some downfalls but, honestly for us, I think the younger part helps us older guys corral everyone together and get on the same page, to really have the same goal. Which is obviously we want to get back to the same spot and this time win that championship game.&quot; 
The Bearcats open the season at home Friday, August 26 against Cansius.
