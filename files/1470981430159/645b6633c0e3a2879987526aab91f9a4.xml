Enegren Brewing toasts 5 years 
Enegren Brewing Company will celebrate its fifth anniversary with a free, family-friendly beer, food and live music event from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Sat., Aug. 20 at the brewery’s facility, 444 Zachary St, Ste. 120, Moorpark. 
For the first time, the brewery will open the outside parking area for the event, doubling the tasting room size for the day. 
To commemorate the occasion, Enegren Brewing has teamed up with Nelson’s Green Brier Distillery— both of which are founded by Loyola Marymount alumni— to produce a special Belgian Dark Strong Ale aged in Belle Meade Bourbon barrels. 
This one-time batch of beer has a rich malty sweetness and plum-like characteristics with notes of bourbon, vanilla, oak and raisin from the bourbon barrels. 
This brew will be on hand for drinking on site, and available to purchase in bottles to go. 
Enegren has over eight beers on tap and cask. 
A special commemorative fifth-anniversary glass will be available for purchase. 
Food trucks will be available from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Live music will run from noon to 8 p.m. 
A second bar setup will be placed outside with extra tables, chairs and tents outside for additional seating. 
For more information, go to www.enegrenbrewing.com/anniversary .
