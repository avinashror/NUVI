PORTLAND, Ore. -- What&apos;s often the best meteor shower of the year — the Perseids — should be even better than usual when the shooting stars appear in the night sky, according to KGW Meteorologist Rod Hill. 
&quot;With the exception of some cloud cover in spots on the coast, the Northwest will be clear tonight and Friday night as the meteor shower peaks,&quot; Hill said Thursday. &quot;Escaping from city lights will allow gazers to see some 40 to 200 meteors per hour.&quot; 
He said this isn&apos;t one of those events where you have to find a specific spot to focus on at a specific time. 
&quot;Simply find a dark sky and look up!&quot; Hill said. 
This one will be an &quot;outburst,&quot; a meteor shower with more meteors than usual. It happens when Earth passes through the heart of the tail of the comet Swift-Tuttle as it orbits around the sun. 
The meteors are actually tiny dust and particles. The particles, many no bigger than a grain of sand or a pea, disintegrate as they blast into our atmosphere at 132,000 mph, making a brilliant flash of light, the American Meteor Society said. 
The last Perseid outburst occurred in 2009, NASA said. 
The viewing declines in numbers after Friday night, Hill said. But the Perseids continue until August 25. 
Meteor showers are named for the constellation out of which they appear to come, said Vincent Perlerin of the American Meteor Society. Look for the constellation Perseus in the northeastern portion of the sky. It&apos;s just to the left of the Pleiades, the Seven Sisters constellation. 
It&apos;s also near the brighter, W-shaped constellation Cassiopeia. 
Early morning sky watchers will be rewarded with a dark backdrop for meteors. On Aug. 12, the waxing gibbous moon, which will be about 70 percent illuminated, will set by 1 a.m. The meteors will then be directly overhead in the moonless hours before dawn. 
What&apos;s an extra bonus about the Perseids is that they can be enjoyed during summer&apos;s warmth, unlike the often nippy nights during the Leonids of November or Geminids of December. 
The Perseids pose no danger to Earth, NASA said, as most burn up 50 miles above our planet.
