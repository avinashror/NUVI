Print Calling all 805 supporters 
The California Public Utilities Commission has recently informed the public that they have scheduled a group of three public hearings and will strongly consider an area code overlay or split of the 805 area code next year. 
Besides affecting our collective identity, a new code will require everyone to dial 11 digits for all calls, including local calls, and will require reprogramming of business and personal telephone systems nationwide. 
I believe this whole thing is unnecessary. There is absolutely no legitimate reason to add a second area code or split the 805 area code, which went into service in 1957. 
Telephone vendors in our region are claiming and reserving a tremendous number of prefixes and seven-digit 805 numbers for no logical reason other than to hoard them. 
The CPUC must audit, investigate and recognize the tremendous number of vacant telephone number in the 805 area code that are dormant and not in use. 
These available telephone numbers should be assigned to real phone subscribers before carving up or adding to our 805 code. 
Personally, I think that we would be far better served if the CPUC focused its attention on aggressively addressing the influx of daily annoying and sometimes fraudulent telemarketing calls that routinely disturb all of us, and enforce the “Do Not Call” list. 
Ventura County’s 805 split/ overlay meeting will be at 2 p.m. Mon., Aug. 22 at the Oxnard City Council offices at 300 W. 3rd St., Oxnard. Please join me in attending. If you’re not able to be there, please voice your concerns or objections to the CPUC in one of the following ways: 
Email . 
Send standard mail to: California Public Utilities Commission, 320 W. 4th St., Suite 500, Los Angeles, CA 90013. 
Send a fax to (415) 703-1758 or call (800) 848-5580. 
Let’s encourage the CPUC to do the right thing and thoroughly examine the true availability of telephone numbers here in the 805 area code before reaching out and inconveniencing everyone for decades to come. You can read more about this issue at www.cpuc.ca.gov/805areacode . 
Let’s preserve our local identity and our area code.
