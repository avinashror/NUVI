BU women&apos;s soccer finds new attitude with Bhattacharjee 
By WBNG Sports   11:59 PM EDT 
VESTAL (WBNG) - The BU women&apos;s soccer team won only three games in 2015, prompting a coaching change. Neel Bhattacharjee is the new head coach in charge of turning the program around. 
After spending time at Syracuse and Boston College Bhattacharjee is not going to be satisfied with losing, but he also knows that change doesn&apos;t happen overnight. The new BU head coach says that the off-season workouts went a long way toward putting the program on track to be able to compete this season.

&quot;One thing that was really critical for us is that we had spring practice with the team,&quot; said Bhattacharjee. &quot;So being with the team during that period of time, it allowed us to have a good opportunity to really change the culture. Set the environment so the players know what the standards are, (and) what the minimum expectations are.&quot; 
&quot;It&apos;s a big adjustment to change coaching systems but I think we have taken it in stride,&quot; said junior Hannah Shankman. &quot;Right away when we met Neel, we knew that he was serious. He meant business and that&apos;s just been the mentality. Everyday you have to work as hard as you can and nothing is given.&quot; 
The BU women open the season on the road at St. Bonaventure on Friday, August 19.
