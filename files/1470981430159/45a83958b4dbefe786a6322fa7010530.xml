THE Orange Tigers may be all but gone in terms of the Central West AFL finals, but that doesn’t mean the side can’t play a big role in the final standings. 
In particular, the Tigers can ruin Cowra’s minor premiership hopes when they travel to Mulyan Oval on Saturday. 
The Blues are locked in a battle for the minor title with the Bathurst Bushrangers Outlaws, the two sides are tied on 56 competition points but the Outlaws have a superior percentage and take top spot as a result. 
Considering the Outlaws also have a far easier run home and are expected to win their final two games easily, a Tigers win would spell the end of Cowra’s somewhat slim minor premiership hopes, although the Blues can’t finish any lower than second. 
After a loss to Parkes last weekend the Tigers’ goals have changed from a potential finals appearance to just finishing the season well, first bounce is at 2.30pm. Latest News
