August 12, 2016 Sharp says China regulators approve Foxconn acquisition 
BEIJING (AP) -- Japan&apos;s Sharp Corp. says China has become the final government to approve the acquisition of the Japanese electronics maker by the Taiwanese company that assembles Apple&apos;s iPhones and the tie-up will go ahead soon. 
Sharp says China&apos;s anti-monopoly agency approved the acquisition by Foxconn and &quot;all examinations by the competition authorities of the relevant countries have been completed.&quot; It said a share issue to complete the transaction would take place &quot;as soon as possible.&quot; 
Foxconn agreed in March to acquire Sharp for $3.5 billion, with plans to turn around the legendary but struggling Japanese brand. 
It was the first foreign takeover of a major Japanese electronics producer. Category
