New Delhi: BJP leader Brijpal Teotia and six others were shot at by unidentified assailants, who allegedly fired more than 100 rounds at his convoy at Muradnagar in Ghaziabad district of Uttar Pradesh late Thursday evening. 
Teotia, who received five bullet injuries, had been rushed to Fortis Hospital in Ghaziabad along with other injured. Their condition is said to be critical. 
Large amounts of ammunition, an AK-47 and two 9mm pistols were found from the crime scene, said police. 
“Police have seized sophisticated arms and ammunition from the crime scene. The Ghaziabad Police have launched an investigation at the spot, while Special Task Force and senior police officers will reach there soon,” said the ADG, adding that their priority is to arrest and bring the assailants to justice. 
Meanwhile, Union Minister Mahesh Sharma, who visited Fortis, Noida, where Teotia and the other six have been admitted, confirmed they were in critical condition, said, “Doctors are saying that they are trying to save his life. It is a matter of investigation, and police will look into it.” 
According to information available, the BJP leader was accompanied by 20 private gunners, in spite of that the assailants attacked his convoy. 
Teotia is said to be a confidante of Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, who has purportedly inquired about the incident from officials of the UP Police.
