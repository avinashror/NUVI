Check out this library story 
Do you ever feel your children are not yours, but belong to the “system”? 
Recently, I called Moorpark Library to reserve a book that my daughter is required to read before school starts. 
Naturally, I placed it under her name, but gave them my email address and cell number to be contacted when the book is ready to be picked up. Great, right? Not so. 
After several days, I received a text from the library alerting me that the book will be released to the next person on the list unless it is picked up within seven days of the notice. 
So, I do what a caring and responsible parent would do for the well being of their child. I go into the library while my daughter is at her school activity with my driver’s license to pick up the book, only to be told that I could not do so. Why? Because my daughter did not give me permission to do so. 
Seriously? I need permission from my minor child to pick up a book that I placed on hold? 
Do you see the problem in this? Why the role reversal? I know at no time did I sign away my rights as the parent of my minor. 
Yet, the library is telling me that I am to receive permission from my child to pick up the book after they texted the information to me. 
Mind you, they will not let me check the book out, but if the book is past due, they will ask me, the parent, to pay the fines. 
I am not saying this is right, but even if it were, why not inform me when I am placing the hold on the book? 
I will leave you with this to contemplate. Do you wonder why our society has lost its values and has no moral compass? It’s because of laws like this that some person decided to pass and take my parental right away from me. Do you think I am furious?
