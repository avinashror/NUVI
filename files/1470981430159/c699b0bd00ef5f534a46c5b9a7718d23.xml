RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Liz Cambage scored 37 points and grabbed 10 rebounds as Australia rallied from 16 points down in the fourth quarter to beat Japan 92-86 and clinch the top spot in Group A heading into the medal round. 
Japan looked like it might join France as the only team to beat the Aussies (4-0) in the Olympics since 1996 other than the U.S. The Japanese used their speed and athleticism to get good looks at the basket against Australia, shooting 59 percent to take a 50-48 halftime lead. 
They led 77-61 early in the fourth quarter, but Cambage started the Aussies’ comeback with a bucket with 7:56 left. She scored 16 points in the final quarter as Australia finished the game on a 31-9 run. Ramu Tokashiki scored 23 points for Japan (2-2), and Mika Kurihara added 20 going 6-for-8 from 3-point range.
