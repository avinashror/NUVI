PILOT POINT -- It&apos;s not much, but Tanna Tuinei has her own locker room inside the Pilot Point High School fieldhouse. 
But it&apos;s outside on the field, the high school senior shows the world that she doesn&apos;t need special treatment. 
&quot;It&apos;s not just a guy thing,&quot; Tuinei said. 
The competitive soccer player is making history by putting on a helmet and shoulder pads and taking the field as the first female football player in Pilot Point.

&quot;I love adrenaline,&quot; Tuinei said. 
It&apos;s her leg that grabbed the attention of special teams coach Greg Lane. 
&quot;She&apos;s got every bit as strong of a leg as any of the guy kickers we have,&quot; Lane said. 
Tuinei has already made the varsity team. This fall, she&apos;ll fight for the starting kicker job. 
She knows how competitive the sport gets after high school, so she still plans to pursue soccer in college, hoping to eventually play professionally. But while she&apos;s on the football team, Tuinei hopes younger girls are watching.

&quot;I want to show them they can get out of the box and do whatever they want, as long as they work hard for it,&quot; she said. 
The National Federation of High School Associations reports that around 1,600 females play football at the high school level. But that&apos;s still a small fraction compared to the more than 1 million males in the sport. 
&quot;I think what she had done is incredible,&quot; Lane said.
