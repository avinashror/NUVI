Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Kentucky judge surprises jail inmate by introducing him to his 1-month-old son for the first time during court hearing. 
(WAVE) A Kentucky judge is making headlines for the kindness she showed an inmate in her courtroom last week. 
24-year-old James Roeder and his wife Ashley were both due in court on the same day on burglary charges. 
Judge Amber Wolf had previously issued a no-contact order between the couple, but she decided to make an exception when she learned about their new baby. 
Their baby had been born while James was in custody, and he had yet to meet his son. She allowed him to hold his son for the very first time. 
There was not a dry eye in the courtroom and Judge Wolf handed out tissues to everyone watching.
