Another Effort to Increase Maternity, Paternity Leave in Calif. Posted on August 11, 2016 FRESNO, Calif. (KMJ) — Legislation aiming to guarantee that new parents can take time off, without the fear of getting fired, is getting another opportunity. http://www.kmjnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/461/2016/08/AA-PAID-FAMILY-LEAAVE-8-11-16-1.mp3 
The measure, which died earlier this summer due to a lack of support, would permit parents whose employer has at least 10 workers, to request up to 12 weeks of maternity or paternity leave half of which could come from the state’s paid family leave program, which was recently fortified by the brown administration. 
It has the support of the California Legislative Women’s Caucus.
