HP&apos;s low-cost Stream laptops now include a 14-inch model Engadget 12 hrs ago Jon Fingas © Provided by Engadget HP is clearly having some success with its cheap-and-cheerful Stream laptops , as it&apos;s expanding them in a big, big way. It&apos;s refreshing the range with not only some under-the-hood upgrades, but a new model.
The Stream 14 (above) effectively replaces the 13-inch version, delivering better performance and a more portable design despite the larger screen. It has faster 2x2 802.11ac WiFi, a 2016-era Celeron processor and a longer 10 hours, 45 minutes of battery life, but weighs less than the old Stream 13 at 3.17 pounds. You won&apos;t be blown away by its 4GB of RAM, 32GB of flash storage or 1,366 x 768 resolution, but the Stream 14 will also start at $219 when it arrives on September 7th. Not bad for a mid-size Windows 10 portable, we&apos;d say.
Other machines are getting a tune-up as well, as you&apos;d expect. The $199 Stream 11 update coming on August 24th will pack the faster WiFi, upgraded processor and slimmer design of its bigger sibling. Meanwhile, the 11-inch Stream x360 (aka HP x360) laptop/tablet hybrid gets similar guts while starting at $249, or $50 less than its ancestor. It arrives in &quot;select regions&quot; sometime in September. And if you&apos;re running a school rather than attending it, there&apos;s a more secure Stream 11 Pro coming in late September with an optional 64GB of storage.
