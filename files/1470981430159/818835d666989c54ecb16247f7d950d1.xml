BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) — One of the hallmarks of the 1980s series &quot;MacGyver,&quot; starring Richard Dean Anderson, is he avoided guns and relied on his wits to disarm or keep the bad guys at bay. 
MacGyver hasn&apos;t changed his outlook in the CBS reboot starring Lucas Till, but that doesn&apos;t mean it will be a gun-free show. 
&quot;It will be unrealistic to do this type of show and not have anybody have any type of gun,&quot; executive producer Peter Lenkov told press Wednesday at an annual summer event for TV critics. &quot;Macgyver&apos;s a guy if he needs a weapon he will build it. 
Someone who will use them, however, is the Jack Dalton character, now played by George Eads, who has a military background. 
&quot;He sees the value in a gun, in a defensive weapon,&quot; Lenkov said. 
&quot;Macgyver&quot; premieres Friday, Sept. 23 at 8 p.m. EDT on CBS.
