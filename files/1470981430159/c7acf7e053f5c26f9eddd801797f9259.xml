Spain Wins First 
Thanks to a strong start, Spain held off Germany winning its first game by a score of 2-1. 
Spain came out ready to prove themselves in this Olympic tournament. The team scored two quick goals, the first of which came from Cristina Guinea on a rebound from a penalty corner attempt. Guinea and her teammates looked ecstatic. 
That energy led to Spain’s next goal. Carola Salvatella swiped the ball away from Germany and dribbled it right up to the goal for a shot. 
Germany had an answer before the half ended. Lisa Schutze beat her defender to score and cut the deficit to one goal. 
The two teams battled back and forth in the third and fourth quarters, but all Spain had to do was maintain strong defense to get the win. Share this:
