What it takes to train a guide dog It takes 2 years, 15,000 hours, and $45,000 to breed, train, and place the dogs with clients August 11, 2016, 11:10 pm Updated: Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) The use of guide animals is on the increase as they become trained to perform specific tasks for more disabilities. 
WESTFIELD, Mass. (WWLP) – The Fidelco Guide Dog Program is looking for dedicated volunteers to house and train a German Shepherd. Though it’s a lengthy program where volunteers can’t get attached, it’s a role that goes from “man’s best friend” to “man’s care taker.” 
Over the last decade, Deb O’Brien has trained 6 guide dogs with Fidelco, calling the process rewarding yet tedious. “Every day you’re waking up and spending your day with them,” says O’Brien. “You’re working with them and training with them and you just have to keep in mind that they’re not your dog.” 
It takes 2 years, 15,000 hours, and $45,000 to breed, train, and place these German Shepherds with a blind client. The clients never pay a penny for the service or companion who will be their eyes. All of the dogs are trained in the city where the client lives, so they can get used to the sounds, smells, and geography. 
Guide dogs stay with clients for an average of 10 years. Most dogs bred and trained with Fidelco are “successor dogs,” meaning, they’re a clients 2nd or 3rd dog. 
But every dog learns to be more than just being someone’s eyes, says Fidelco Development Director Susan Greer; their role is to protect. “We hear it all the time that people are saved from cars by their dogs, who keep them from stepping into traffic, which is something we train them for.” 
Fidelco guide dogs have gone on to help blind clients get in shape to compete in the Paralympics, and even to climb Mt. Everest.
