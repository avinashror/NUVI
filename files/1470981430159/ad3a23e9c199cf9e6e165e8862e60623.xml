@nickmcgrath4 12 Aug 2016, 1:30 p.m. With a final round clash in Orange, Ex-Services can secure a top two spot with a win over Parkes

A huge reward that would net the club a home semi-final in week one of the post season, Servies must beat Parkes in Orange on Saturday by five or more goals to leap frog Bathurst St Pat’s into second, with the blue and whites sitting out the final round thanks to their second bye. 
Player-coach Leanne Kennewell though, was just focused on a win, regardless of the margin. 
“We need to win, that’s all we’re worried about,” she said, with fourth-placed Bathurst City just two points behind and likely to chalk up a big win against Lithgow Zig Zag. 
“We’ll reassess how things are going during the game, but we haven’t set any goals around scoring a five-goal win or anything. We’re not putting that pressure on ourselves.” 
Servies won 1-0 over in Parkes earlier in the season, pointing towards another close encounter given United is also finals bound, currently immovable from fifth on the ladder. 
Kennewell said the two sides traditionally always play out a tough game. 
“It’s always physical,” she said. 
“They’ve got a number of really handy players in their side is probably their goal keeper.” 
Parkes has the third best defensive record of any side in the competition, conceding just 25 goals in 14 games throughout 2016 – that’s better than both Servies (31) and St Pat’s (32), two sides both ahead of United on the ladder. 
Kennewell said a greater sense of team unity than past campaigns was the key behind her side’s success so far this year. 
“We’re really enjoying each other’s company,” she said. 
“We’ve all tried a lot of different positions as well, and there hasn’t been any complaining. We’re a versatile side and I think that’s shown in our results.” 
Should Ex-Services account for Parkes on Saturday, they’ll play St Pat’s either in Orange or Bathurst, defending on results. 
Either way, Kennewell said her side was determined to make an impact in the semi-finals. 
“We know we can beat them,” she said. Saturday’s game begins at 1.10pm. Latest News
