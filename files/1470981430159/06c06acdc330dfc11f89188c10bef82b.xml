Two convicted felons were arrested on drug charges following a motor vehicle stop in Bristol, according to police. 
Police said 32-year-old Matthew Aylward and 43-year-old Roderick Mack were found to be in possession of drugs. 
Officers said they saw the pair commit a motor vehicle violation as they left Davis Drive near part of a Bristol Housing Authority neighborhood around 7:30 p.m. on Wednesday. 
Police stopped the vehicle in the parking lot of a Walgreens pharmacy on Farmington Avenue, where the driver was identified as Aylward. Mack was the passenger. 
An investigation revealed illegal drugs, which prompted the arrest of the pair. Police did not reveal the kind of drugs the suspects allegedly had. 
Aylward was charged with possession of drug paraphernalia, possession with intent to sell within 1,500 feet of a prohibited place, illegal distribution/sale of narcotics and illegal possession of narcotics. 
He was released from custody after posting a $25,000 bond. He was given a court date of Aug. 22 in Bristol. 
Mack was charged with possession of drug paraphernalia, illegal possession of narcotics, tempering with evidence and interfering with a police officer. 
He was held on a $10,000 bond and set to face a judge on Thursday.
