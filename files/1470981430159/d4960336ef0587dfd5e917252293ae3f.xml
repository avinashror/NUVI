YORKSHIRE are through to only their second Finals Day after annihilating Glamorgan in Cardiff last night by 90 runs defending a 181 target. 
David Willey smashed a blistering 79 to underpin a score of 180-8, although the Vikings total should have been in the region of 210-220. 
They lost seven wickets for 59 runs inside nine overs during the second half of their innings to give Glamorgan a sniff in front of a 10,087 crowd. 
  
But Tim Bresnan struck with the first ball of the Glamorgan chase, forcing David Lloyd to chop onto his stumps, and the Welshmen slumped to 34-5 after six and were later bowled out for 90 in 13 overs, their lowest ever score. 
Adil Rashid finished with 4-26 from his three overs. 
Yorkshire’s hopes of completing an historic treble this season are still very much alive, and they will face Durham on Finals Day at Edgbaston on Saturday August 20. 
Yorkshire’s innings, after Alex Lees won the toss, went from the sublime to the ridiculous at the venue of their only previous Finals Day appearance in 2012. 
They got off to a racing start through the star man Willey, who smashed seven fours and six sixes in a 38-ball blast at the top of the order. 
He shared a second-wicket partnership of 74 in just 6.3 overs with Lees, whose 36 off 24 was the next best score of an innings which subsided. 
Part-time leg-spinner Colin Ingram starred with 4-32 to recover things for a home side whose fielding was sloppy at best. 
They were under the cosh as early as the first over when former White Rose favourite Jacques Rudolph dropped a sitter at mid-on to let Adam Lyth off the hook off the bowling of Timm van der Gugten. 
It was a sign that it just wasn’t going to be Glamorgan’s night against a side who had won six of their last seven North group games to qualify. 
That theory was tested during the second half of the Vikings innings as Ingram bowled Willey and Jack Leaning, had Will Rhodes lbw and Liam Plunkett caught superbly at long-off by Graham Wagg. 
It was a career best haul for the South African, who had only taken five wickets in the entire competition prior to this fixture. 
Thankfully, Glamorgan were back under the cosh inside the first five overs of their chase as they slipped to 28-4, with Matthew Waite getting key man Ingram caught at third-man with only his fifth ball of the season. 
Waite, 20-years-old, had come into the side in place of Australian Travis Head, and he had also hit a useful 15-ball 19 with the bat. 
Bresnan also struck twice with the new ball and Willey once as Glamorgan’s hopes went up in smoke in decent batting conditions. 
After removing Lloyd, he had fellow opener Mark Wallace caught at cover in the third over before Willey bowled Aneurin Donald in the fourth. 
Waite’s wicket left Glamorgan at 28-4 in the fifth, and it was soon 34-5 after six as Plunkett bowled Wagg. 
Rashid then mopped up the tail. 
He had Craig Meschede superbly caught at long-on by Plunkett, bowled Andrew Salter and Michael Hogan and had van der Gugten caught in the deep.
