She offered few new details on her own policy, and instead devoted most of her time to slamming Donald Trump&apos;s tax plan, which he discussed Monday .
Here are the facts behind Clinton&apos;s speech.
CLAIM: &quot;An independent analysis by a former economic adviser to Senator John McCain,&quot; Clinton said, found that Trump&apos;s platform would lead to 3.4 million in job losses, while her plan would create 10 million jobs.
THE FACTS: Clinton is referring to a June assessment by Moody&apos;s Analytics. It was authored by several economists, but led by Mark Zandi. Zandi was in fact one of McCain&apos;s advisers — but he&apos;s also a registered Democrat and a donor who has maxed out to Clinton&apos;s campaign.
The Moody&apos;s analysis did say that Trump&apos;s policies would result in 3.4 million in job losses over the course of his potential presidency, reading in part: &quot;The economic damage created by Mr. Trump&apos;s policies is also stark when considering how the economy would perform if there were no significant changes to policy.&quot; Moody&apos;s July report on Clinton&apos;s economic plan said it would create 10.4 million new jobs over the course of her hypothetical presidency.

CLAIM: &quot;Then there&apos;s the Estate Tax, which Trump wants to eliminate altogether. If you believe that he&apos;s as wealthy as he says, that alone would save the Trump family $4 billion. But it would do nothing for 99.8 percent of Americans.&quot;
THE FACTS: Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, said this mostly checks out. The Estate Tax — which Republicans prefer to call the Death Tax — only affects estates worth more than $5 million, and just 0.2 percent of people who die each year surpass that threshold. The $4 billion figure though, based on Trump&apos;s stated net worth of $10 billion, is a bit trickier since Trump could employ a number of tax avoidance mechanisms.
CLAIM: &quot;I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages — including the Trans-Pacific Partnership. I oppose it now, I&apos;ll oppose it after the election, and I&apos;ll oppose it as President.&quot;

Image: US-VOTE-CLINTON THE FACTS: Clinton came late to opposing the TPP: She called it the &quot;gold standard&quot; of trade deals when she was Secretary of State. She now says she opposes it, and would as president, though critics on both the right and left remain suspicious.
Related: How did Donald Trump&apos;s Claims Hold Up?
CLAIM: Clinton said Trump called for a new loophole in his Monday speech that would allow him &quot;to pay less than half the current tax rate on income from many of his companies.&quot; She added that he would &quot;pay a lower rate than millions of middle class families.&quot;
THE FACTS: The Washington Post delved into what Clinton calls the &quot;Trump loophole,&quot; which would effectively lower the tax rate on high-income &quot;pass-through&quot; entities — companies that file taxes through their individual owners, rather than at corporate rates — from 39.6 percent to 15 percent.
Williams said Clinton is right to say that Trump&apos;s companies would indeed pay half the current tax rate. But he said it&apos;s harder to state definitively whether that would be lower than middle-class families&apos; rates, since it would depends on their income level, and thus tax rate, as well as the amount they pay in payroll taxes. Under Trump&apos;s plan, an estimated 63 percent of low-and-middle-class Americans would pay no federal income taxes at all.

THE FACTS: The IRS periodically puts out data on the top 400 taxpayers. While Williams said it&apos;s difficult to measure this claim in detail, he guesses they&apos;d save between $10 and $15 million. &quot;They&apos;d save a lot of money,&quot; he said.
CLAIM: &quot;The tax cuts he doubled down on in his speech on Monday offer trillions to the richest Americans and corporations.&quot;
THE FACTS: Clinton may be high-balling here, but it&apos;s difficult to know for sure without more details on Trump&apos;s new tax plan. The Tax Policy Center estimated that Trump&apos;s old tax proposal would cut federal revenues by $9.5 trillion over the first 10 years, and that &quot;high-income taxpayers would receive the biggest cuts, both in dollar terms and as a percentage of income.&quot; However, Trump altered key portions of his plan Monday with the goal of making it $7 trillion less expensive, so the old analysis is out of date.
