Lamborghini Squadra Corse launches kart racing training program Text: / Photos: Lamborghini | posted August 12, 2016 11:37 Designed for young kart drivers Beginners in open-wheeler racing dream of reaching the top table in Formula 1 and IndyCar. But with the limited seats available, only a few can reach this dream. As the popularity rises for GT Racing at the 2016 Total 24 Hours of Spa, young racing drivers are realizing opportunities aside from open-wheel racing. With this, factory racing team Lamborghini Squadra Corse decided to launch a new kart racer training program designed to bring young kart racers into GT Racing. Danilo Rossi, the five-time world champion karter and founder of DR Racing Kart, will serve as the talent scout for this program. For the first run, he chose Justas Jonusis and Muiz Gafar who are the youngest karters at 14 years old. Next were 20-year old Cristopher Zani and 29-year old Mauro Simoni. They held their first training session at Adria circuit in Italy wherein Mirko Bortolotti, factory dirver, taught them about the technical and teamwork aspects of GT racing. After the training, Bortolotti gave them a ride in the Super Trofeo Huracan to get a taste of driving in GT3. This new karting program will serve only as the start of the young drivers&apos; training in motorsport racing. It will eventually take them Formula 4, Super Trofeo Series and lastly GT3 racing.
