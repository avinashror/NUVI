Nadal halfway to second singles gold Nadal halfway to second singles gold NBC Olympics.com Published: Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) 
After an unexpected day of rest (all tennis matches were canceled Wednesday), Spain’s World No. 5 Rafael Nadal continued his singles hot streak by defeating France’s Simon Gilles on Thursday morning. 
Nadal was a little slower out of the gate in this third round match, with Gilles leading at first. The two played catch-up with one another until they reached a first set tiebreak. The Spaniard managed to clinch the tiebreak and the set, 7(7)-6(5). The second set, on the other hand, wasn’t even close. After establishing a three-game lead, Nadal ultimately beat Gilles 6-3. Final score: 7(7)-6(5), 6-3. 
Throughout, the World No. 5 utilized smart tactics and his typical aggressive style. But especially during the first set, he looked tired. In addition to singles, Nadal is in the men’s doubles semifinals (alongside countryman Marc Lopez; they compete at approximately 2 PM ET on court 3) and will begin playing mixed doubles alongside Spain’s Garbine Muguruza either later on Thursday or early Friday. Could the Spainard spread himself too thin? 
The 14-time Grand Slam winner has now booked a quarterfinal match-up, against either Brazil’s unseeded Thomaz Bellucci or Belgium’s 8th-seeded David Goffin . Share this:
