  2016 Top Returning Volleyball Players By Sean Greene 7:15pm, August 11, 2016 Setter Sydney Fulton figures to have plenty of passing options for DMA this fall Delaware Military Academy returns volleyball player of the year Sydney Fulton and all but one member from last year&apos;s title squad as they look to repeat this season. The Seahawks said goodbye to captain Cassie Kowalski, but setter Sydney Fulton and outside hitter Victoria Taylor return off of 2015&apos;s First Team list. Kowalski&apos;s absense could open more hitting opportunities for seniors Natalie Lavelle and Lindsay Wolfe, along with sophomore Jacqualine Shields. Padua, who has reached the last two semifinals after back-to-back titles welcomes back powerful outside hitter Emily Jarome for her junior season, and she&apos;ll be joined by second-team member Maddie Judge. Lauren Mellor also figures to make an impact for the Pandas. Wilmington Friends&apos; Alyssa Nathan rounds out the returning 1st-team trio, and her rapidly improving sister Dani will be back for her sophomore year to try to smash home some of her sets. Dani claimed the Division II High Jump in the DIAA Outdoor Track &amp; Field Championships in May. Charter School of Wilmington said goodbye to Kristen Edminson, but outside hitter Madeline Matheny returns for her sophomore season to lead a team that lost just three seniors off of a quarterfinal squad. A. I. duPont senior Sydney MacDonald and Tower Hill sophomore Maddie Sachs are also looking to build off of 2nd-Team campaigns in 2015. From 2015&apos;s Third Team, Tatnall setter and Ursuline libero Samantha Davis will kick off their junior campaigns. 2016&apos;s regular season is highlighted by the traditional double round-robin between the Catholic Conference schools of Ursuline, Padua, St. Elizabeth, and St. Mark&apos;s. DMA&apos;s schedule opens against Maryland 2A champion Rising Sun, a rematch of one of the best matches in Delaware last fall. Copyright © Aug 11,
