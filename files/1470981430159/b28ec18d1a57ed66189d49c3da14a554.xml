Team USA’s Chew and Subandhi fall in Mixed Double’s action Team USA&apos;s Chew and Subhandi fall in Mixed Double&apos;s action NBC Olympics.com Published: Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) 
The U.S’ first Badminton action of the day did not go well as mixed double’s pairing, Phillip Chew and Jamie Subandhi, lost to Ko Sung Hyun and partner Kim Ha Na 2-0. The Korean duo is the second ranked mixed doubles team in the world so it was understandable that the inexperience Chew and Subandhi would have difficulty. The tandem battled valiantly in the second match for a brief spell but the effort didn’t pay off. The Americans lost 21-10 in the first match and 21-12 in the second to fall to 0-1 in Group D play. 
Chew and Subandhi’s next match is vs. Japan’s Kenta Kazuno and Ayane Kurihara on Friday evening. The Japanese pairing defeated the Netherland’s Jacco Arend and Selena Piek 2-0 in its first group match earlier today.
