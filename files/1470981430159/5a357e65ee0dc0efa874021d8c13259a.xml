It&apos;s hard to believe the games opened just one week ago. 
Already so much has happened, but no time to dwell on the past because it is a full Day 7 for Georgia Athletes. There are just under 20 athletes competing today! Plus, track and field gets underway. 
Here&apos;s what you have to look forward to: 
Golf 
GOLF Channel 6:30 a.m.-3 p.m. 
Matt Kuchar has himself in a good position going into the second round. He is tied for 11th after shooting a 69 in the first 18 holes. The same can&apos;t be said for Patrick Reed, who sits at 32nd place, or Bubba Watson, who is in 43rd. But that doesn&apos;t mean they aren&apos;t having fun representing the U.S. and seeing those Capybaras. Those are the real story!
