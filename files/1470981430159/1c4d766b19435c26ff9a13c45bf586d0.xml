Second-seeded Andy Murray defeated Italy’s unseeded Fabio Fognini on Centre Court Thursday afternoon, despite some significant difficulties. 
The British World No. 2 player, now the singles favorite due to World No. 1 Novak Djokovic ’s first-round departure, took a decisive 6-1 first set from Fognini. But in the second set, Fognini seemed to gain confidence. He was unafraid to engage in longer rallies, patiently waiting for his shot. The Italian’s consistent style of play emphasized seizing opportunities as opposed to fancy shots or aggressive hitting. Fognini won the second set 6-2. 
A clearly frustrated Murray had to bring his A-game to the third set, but lost the first two games. After shouting to his team and throwing a few fist-pumps, Murray began to play better tennis. He came from behind in the third set to win 6-1, 2-6, 6-3. 
Murray is the defending singles gold medalist. He’s set to play 12th-seeded American Steve Johnson in the quarterfinal round.
