MESQUITE -- A determined theft suspect led police on a wild, hour-long chase from Mesquite to Dallas and back again during Thursday evening&apos;s rush hour. 
It began just before 6:00 p.m., when a Target loss prevention officer confronted an alleged thief as he left the store with stolen merchandise at 1629 North Town East Boulevard. The suspect fought the officer, dropped the goods, and took off in a waiting truck. 
Mesquite police gave chase east on Interstate 30 with Dallas Sheriff&apos;s Deputies and a DPS helicopter joining in as the fleeing truck drove into Dallas. 
From westbound I-30, the driver turned northbound on Interstate 35E, then onto surface streets, where his passenger jumped out and surrendered to officers at Nogales and Webb Chapel. 
From there, the chase wound north on US 75 to eastbound Interstate 635. Along the way, the fleeing driver reached speeds approaching 90 miles per hour, and eluded officers by driving the wrong way into oncoming traffic.

An hour into the pursuit, the chase returned to Mesquite, ending unceremoniously when the truck ran out of gas and the driver surrendered at La Prada and Oates. 
The driver of the suspect has been identified as 45-year-old Joe Daniel Sanchez. The passenger has been identified as 36-year-old Marlon Alberto Duran. Police say both men are from Dallas. 
The specific charges each suspect will face were unclear as of Thursday night.
