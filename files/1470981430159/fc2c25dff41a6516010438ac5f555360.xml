RIO DE JANEIRO -- Sugar Land&apos;s Simone Manuel is an Olympic gold medal winner. 
Manuel, 20, tied for gold during the 100-meter freestyle Thursday night, becoming the first African-American woman to win an Olympic medal in an individual swimming event. Manuel made a late push during the race to catch Penny Oleksiak of Canada. The two both touched the wall at exactly 52.70. 
After the race, Manuel said &quot;all I can say is all glory to God. It&apos;s definitely been a long journey these past four years, and I&apos;m just so blessed to have the gold medal. 
&quot;The medal is not just for me, it&apos;s for a whole bunch of people who have came before me and been an inspiration to me, and it&apos;s for all the people after me who believe they can&apos;t do it. I want to be an inspiration to them that they can do it.&quot; Loading...
