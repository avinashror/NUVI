Curfew, restrictions imposed across Kashmir IANS Friday 12th August, 2016 Srinagar, Aug 12 (IANS) Authorities on Friday imposed curfew and restrictions across Kashmir to prevent protests called by the separatists.
Police said restrictions and curfew will remain in force in all the 10 district headquarters of the Valley in addition to Handwara, Kupwara, Sopore, Trehgam and Qaimoh. 
&quot;These precautionary measures have been taken to maintain law and order in the Valley&quot;, a senior police officer said here.
