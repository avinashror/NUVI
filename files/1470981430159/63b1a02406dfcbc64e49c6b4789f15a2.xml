ROCKWALL -- A Rockwall non-profit marked a major milestone last week in their mission to provide the world with clean drinking water. 
&quot;When they say, &apos;Welcome to the end of the world,&apos; they say it a little tongue-in-cheek, but you can tell that beneath that is a very deep feeling of disconnect and being forgotten,&quot; said Todd Phillips, founder of The Last Well . 
That organization is dedicated to providing the people of Liberia with a source of clean, drinkable water. 
Texans are familiar with the small African country of Liberia for a different reason. The country gained worldwide attention during the Ebola crisis in 2014.

&quot;Monrovia, [a city of] 1.7 million people, looked like a ghost town&quot; Phillips said. 
Phillips and his team were in country during the most devastating outbreak of Ebola in Liberia&apos;s history. 
&quot;We saw a total of three people on the road. It was the most surreal experience I&apos;ve ever had, and we were there for it,&quot; he said. 
Their mission is to bring clean drinking water to the people of Liberia by 2020. 
&quot;If you think about Ebola, Ebola took the lives of about 4,000 people in Liberia,&quot; Phillips said. &quot;The same number of people die from water-borne diseases every forty days.&quot; 
Liberia is divided in to 15 counties, and last week one of those counties had a major milestone: All of its residents are now within a 15-minute walk of year-round, clean drinking water. 
According to Phillips, that&apos;s a first for the small county, and the first for any governmental region in all of West Africa.

&quot;To say it was a celebration is an understatement,&quot; Philips told us. &quot;You&apos;ve got up to a hundred people, mostly children, dying. One hundred a day, mostly due to water-borne diseases and illness, just inside this small country. For this region, children no longer die.&quot; Click here to learn more about The Last Well 
Hand-made wells, rain collection, and sophisticated-yet-simple filtration units helped accomplish their goal. Phillips was only a few years into his mission when he realized another Texan shared a similar vision. 
Former Dallas professional soccer player Doc Lawson is a Liberian native and humanitarian was also in country during the Ebola crisis. He&apos;s now a full-time part of The Last Well&apos;s staff. 
&quot;Child mortality is dropping precipitously,&quot; Phillips said. &quot;Kids who were going eight hours a day to get dirty water from creeks are now going to school, and they have a hope and a future.&quot; 
A future that starts with something so many of us take for granted.
