It ain&apos;t easy being green, just ask the Olympic diving pool . 
But &quot;green&quot; appears to be the color of the Rio Olympics -- the logo, the pool and now Ryan Lochte&apos;s hair. 
As you may or may not know, U.S .swimmer Ryan Lochte dyed his hair. It was a new look for Rio . Aug 1, 2016 at 11:09am PDT 

However, it didn&apos;t stay that color for very long. A gold-medal-winning swim in the men&apos;s 4x200m freestyle relay turned his hair as green as the other Rio pool. 
Yikes! Aug 9, 2016 at 11:54pm PDT 

But, hey, gold goes with any color.
