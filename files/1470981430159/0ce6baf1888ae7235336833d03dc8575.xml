Zayn Malik Adds Shoe Designer to His Resumé with a Giuseppe Zanotti Collab Well this is unexpected... 
Zayn Malik has gone from soulful singer to shoe designer at the drop of a hat. The star took to social media this morning to reveal that he has collaborated with fashion designer Giuseppe Zanotti on a mini collection of shoes that will hit shelves early next year. The lineup will include a pair of suede desert boots, which the former One Direction member posted a photo of on Twitter and Instagram ( below ) with the caption: &quot;#GiuseppexZayn Coming 2017.&quot; The series will also include three additional styles.

And as for why he chose to work with Zanotti, Malik was clear. &quot;Style is not being afraid to be bold about some things, or to say what it is you have to say,&quot; Zayn tells GQ of the collaboration. &quot;I feel like Giuseppe does that with his collection—and I try to do that with my music. So it kind of works.&quot; And it looks like the &quot;Cruel&quot; singer isn&apos;t the only one excited about his new project. Malik&apos;s supermodel girlfriend Gigi Hadid was quick to show her support for his new project—she shared a snap of her beau wearing Zanotti kicks on Instagram with the caption &quot;dreamy.&quot; A photo posted by Zayn Malik (@zayn) on Aug 11, 2016 at 4:05am PDT 
Look for the Giuseppe x Zayn collection when it launches in Jan. 2017.
