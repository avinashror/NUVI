CCSD School board share concerns about reorganization plan By Ashley Forest 1470980413000 A plan to put principals, teachers, and parents in charge of the Clark County School District was met Thursday night with scrutiny and criticism. 8/11/16 (Kelsey Thomas / KSNV) 0 shares tweet now! LAS VEGAS (KSNV News3LV) — 
A plan to put principals, teachers, and parents in charge of the Clark County School District was met Thursday night with scrutiny and criticism. 
For the first time, we heard from the district’s biggest decision markers: the CCSD Board of Trustees. 
&quot;What I worry about is the costs of this and I know they say we&apos;re going to pay for it, but I don&apos;t know where we&apos;re going to get the money from,” said CCSD Trustee Kevin Child. 
&quot;I still don&apos;t think that we&apos;re adequately addressing student achievement,” said CCSD Trustee Deanna Wright. 
The proposal would shake up local classrooms. 
&quot;It&apos;s not acceptable to have one of the worst school systems in the country,” said Republican State Senator Michael Roberson. 
Roberson heads up a committee that developed a plan that would essentially flip the school district model on its head. 
&quot;Parents, teachers, and principals are going to make decisions over the education of the children in those schools, rather than a bureaucrat who may have never been in the school,” he explained. 
&quot;For the first time, money will truly follow the child,” he continued.

Annette Dawson-Owens is a mother of six. She has been a teacher with CCSD for 20 years. She said the plan would empower our children. 
&quot;When you have that collaboration and when you&apos;re able to actually discuss the kids at your school, and make changes you need to it, all studies have shown, achievement naturally flows, because you&apos;re able to target the needs of your school,” said Annette Dawson-Owners. 
Lawmakers are set to approve a final plan on Tuesday. It then goes on to the Nevada state Board of Education for consideration and approval. component-story-more_media_horiz-v1-01
