Air Force dealing with pilot shortage; Westover unaffected Airlines able to recruit more pilots during good economic times Sy Becker Published: August 11, 2016, 6:07 pm Updated: Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) 
CHICOPEE, Mass. (WWLP) – It is a sure sign that America’s economy is improving when the Air Force has difficulty recruiting pilots. 
Westover Air Reserve Base Chief of Public Affairs Lt. Col. James Bishop said that when times are good, the commercial airlines start hiring more pilots for their increased flights. This reduces that talent pool for the Air Force. 
Bishop, however, told 22News that Westover is not feeling the crunch. There is no immediate concern for its C-5B cargo planes having enough pilots. 
“The (Air Force) Reserve is unique, in that our pilots can work in both places. They can work as reserve pilots and then they can work in the airlines,” Bishop said. 
As a result of the war plane pilot shortage, the Air Force is now providing recruits with bonuses to counteract the competition from the airlines. Share this:
