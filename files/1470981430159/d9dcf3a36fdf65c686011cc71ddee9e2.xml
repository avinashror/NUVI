Print Truck traffic getting worse 
Take notice Moorpark residents, we have an outstanding young man living right in Moorpark. He is a young man in the Boy Scouts. His name in Dylan Masson. 
This young man had a letter printed in the Moorpark Acorn, July 29. I hope you took the time to read his letter. For such a young man, he trying to do something about the traffic. First I say, kudos to him. 
Now the trick here is to have our city government notice. This boy is only 11 years old and he already notices the truck traffic is getting worse. 
I can remember when I was about his age— a very long time ago— I would sit on the edge of the hill where my family was raised. Our home overlooked Walnut Canyon Road. I was lucky to count maybe 14 trucks go by. Of course this was a weekend, I guess. 
The road that went up the hill to our house was never paved and today it is still a dirt road 72 years later. 
My grandchild have asked me, “Why do we have so much traffic?” My only answer is everyone passes the buck. No one wants to claim responsibility between the city, Caltrans, the state of California and Ventura County. 
One big problem here is the 118 and 123 freeways both have three or four lanes coming into Moorpark. But when they get to Moorpark, guess what. There are only two lanes. 
Now, if you like to sign up for defensive driving course, come practice here at Walnut Canyon Road. 
And if you like to go for a two-mile run or walk, come do it here, but just make sure you have a very good life insurance policy. 
Did I say we have no sidewalks? Have fun.
