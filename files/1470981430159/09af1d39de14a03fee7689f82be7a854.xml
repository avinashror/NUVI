Could South Carolina Become a Battleground State? Could South Carolina become a blue state? Joyce Koh, wltx 10:18 PM. EST August 11, 2016 Clinton and Trump CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST 
Columbia, SC (WLTX)- A poll released Thursday shows Donald Trump leading in South Carolina 41 to 39, just two points ahead of Hillary Clinton. 
The Public Policy Polling (PPP) poll, sponsored by the SC Democratic Party, has some questioning whether or not the historically red South Carolina could flip to blue come November. 
Democrats said this poll shows Clinton has a chance to win. Democratic Party Chairman Jaime Harrison was optimistic about the results. 
&quot;She might break two glass ceilings,&quot; he said. &quot;The first glass ceiling is a woman in the White House, and the second glass ceiling is a democrat winning in the south again on the presidential level.&quot; 
However, chairman of the SC Republican Party Matt Moore said after two consecutive terms under one political party, Americans have voted for change. 
&quot;Hillary Clinton has an uphill battle, just simply due of that,&quot; Moore said. &quot;Donald Trump and Michael Pence represent certainly a big change from how things have been done for the past 7 and a half years.&quot; 
Historically, South Carolinians have voted republican with percentages hovering around 55-45. The last time SC voted democrat was for Jimmy Carter in 1976. 
Even with record voter turnout among democrats in 2008 with the Obama and McCain race, that margin stood true, 54-45. 
Political Analyst and Professor at USC, Robert Oldendick said while the race could be tight, a Clinton win isn&apos;t likely to happen. 
&quot;You would be silly to say never in an election like this,&quot; Oldendick said. &quot;If it&apos;s one of those things where [Trump&apos;s] campaign doesn&apos;t get turned around, and more and more people take away their support and endorse Secretary Clinton, especially if its prominent republicans that do this, there could be a slim chance, but it&apos;s very unlikely.&quot;
