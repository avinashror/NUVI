Field condition concerns take shape a day before USA vs. Sweden quarterfinal Field condition concerns take shape a day before USA vs. Sweden quarterfinal NBC Olympics.com Published: Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) 
The U.S. women kick off the knockout round of the Olympic women’s soccer tournament with their quarterfinal match against Sweden on Friday at noon ET at the Mane Garrincha Stadium in Brasilia. 
According to CSN Mid-Atlantic’s Sebastian Salazar , the field at the stadium is in poor shape just a day before the match. After two men’s soccer matches on Wednesday night, the Brasilia stadium has hosted nine matches since the start of the Olympics. This is not the first time the U.S. women’s soccer team has dealt with poor field conditions. In December 2015, the team canceled one of its World Cup Victory Tour matches due to subpar playing conditions.
