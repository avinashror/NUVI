Updated: August 12, 2016 10:42 IST SHRC to inquire into alleged harassment of court staff Staff Reporter Tweet The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has directed the State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) to conduct an inquiry into the alleged harassment of a court staff by the Subordinate Judge of Sathyamangalam. It was based on a complaint from S. Balamurugan, State secretary of People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL). The development has taken place about six months after the Subordinate Judge reportedly sought an explanation from his woman office staff on February 1, 2016, on reluctance shown by her in washing innerwear in his house. The judge also asked why action should not be taken against her. In her response to the judge (in writing), the same week the staff apologised for her act and assured not to indulge in such acts. Both the letters went viral in the social media and also attracted a strong protest from court staff. According to the letter from the Assistant Registrar of NHRC, the complaint from the PUCL secretary dated April 3 was placed before the commission on June 22. In the direction dated June 25, the NHRC asked the SHRC to pursue the complaint and to dispose it in accordance with the provision of the Human Rights Act. Mr. Balamurugan said that the copy of the letter to the complainant (himself) reached him on Wednesday. He expressed confidence that the outcome of the inquiry by the SHRC would put an end to such harassments of court staff.
