MINNEAPOLIS - A shooting suspect is in custody after a harrowing sprint across a busy freeway in Minneapolis. 
Police say the man was one of three suspects arrested following the shooting, which took place Thursday morning near the intersection of 38th and Fremont Avenue North. Officers responded to reports of multiple shots fired around 10:10 a.m. and found a victim with a non-life threatening gunshot wound to the face. 
According to witnesses at the scene, the 62-year-old victim was standing at a bus stop when two groups started shooting at each other. He was hit on the nose by a bullet, after being caught in the crosshairs. 
Authorities say the State Patrol attempted to stop a vehicle in the area for an equipment violation when two of the suspects bailed out of the car and ran. A third suspect was taken into custody near where the vehicle was stopped. 
One of the suspects who fled was taken into custody after he was seen sprinting across I-94 near 57th Avenue North. MnDOT cameras looked on as the man dodged vehicles moving at freeway speeds. Another man was arrested at 57th Avenue North and Camden. 
At this time it is unclear what led to the shooting. Minneapolis Police are investigating.
