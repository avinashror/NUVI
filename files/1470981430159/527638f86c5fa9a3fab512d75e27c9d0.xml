PETALING JAYA (The Star/Asia News Network) - Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, who was admitted to the National Heart Institute (IJN) for treatment of a chest infection, is recuperating well. 
In a statement Friday, IJN said the former prime minister continues to respond well to the treatment. 
&quot;Apart from physiotherapy, Dr Mahathir is also currently being put through routine physical exercise. Doctors are happy with his progress,&quot; it said, adding that he is now admitted in the general ward. 
IJN said based on the medical team&apos;s advice, visitation is strictly for close family members only. 
Dr Mahathir, the country&apos;s prime minister for 22 years until he stepped down in 2003, has undergone two heart surgeries. 
The past few months have been busy for him as he was involved in the formation of the new Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia together with former deputy prime minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin. Topics:
