Print Sign-ups open for YMCA school programs 
YMCA branches serving the Conejo Valley, Simi Valley and Moorpark are registering students in kindergarten through fifth grade for before- and after-school child care programs. 
Conejo Valley YMCA will provide child care at Peach Hill Academy and Mountain Meadows Elementary in Moorpark and MATES Charter School in Thousand Oaks. 
The program includes time for homework, outdoor play and opportunities to acquire new skills in a positive environment. 
Child care is available on all school days, pupil-free days and minimum days. Camp programs are held during Thanksgiving, winter and spring breaks, and any school furlough days. 
Children can attend full time or part time with flexible time slots available. Transportation will be provided to the YMCA child care sites from other surrounding schools if enough kids from each school participate. For more information, go to www.sevymca.org or call the participating branches directly.
