RIO DE JANEIRO - Four years is a long time, and no one knows that better than Missy Franklin. 
Back in 2012, the 17-year-old was the darling of the London Games, winning five Olympic medals and winning over the world with her big smile. 
Now, she’s done with what she termed a “disappointing”Olympics that included: Her failing to qualify for both the 200 freestyle and 200 back finals; and her swimming with the 4x200 free relay in its preliminary heat, not the final. Her grand medal total is one, gold from the relay, but she only got it because she swam in prelims. She did not get to stand on the podium, medal on her neck, listening to the national anthem with her teammates. 
Franklin seems legitimately perplexed about her poor performances this week, and why she was not able to swim fast here in Rio. 
“This is a disappointing meet for me,” Franklin, 21, said Thursday afternoon. “But life goes on. This is just one phase of my life that I worked so hard for and made so many sacrifices for. For whatever reason, this meet didn’t go my way. But that doesn’t mean I’m anywhere close to being done with this sport or that I don’t have anything left to give. Because I do. I have so much more left to give to this sport, to my fans, to the people that have been supporting me. It’s a disappointment, but the support that I’ve received has shown me so much more than I could have ever expected about — you’re so much more than just the number of medals, you’re so much more than the time you are in a pool. Your value goes beyond all of that. I don’t think I would have ever come to that realization without something like this.” 
Franklin was asked what she’s learned throughout the week of adversity. She said to ask her again in a few weeks. 
“Right now, it sucks,” Franklin said, laughing. “Right now, it’s my faith in God that’s really getting me through. He’s going to transform me and my life into doing something from all of this. I have no cluse what that is, and I wish I could ask Him what to do, but right now I have to have faith that it’s going to happen.” 
Franklin said her parents have remained positive this week, reminding her that everything will be OK and those around her still love her no matter what. 
“When you put things in perspective, if a disappointing swim meet is the worst thing that happens to me in my life, then I’m having a good life,” Franklin said. Loading...
