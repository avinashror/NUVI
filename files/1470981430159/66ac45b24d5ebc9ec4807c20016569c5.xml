Man tricks petrol station attendant and friend robs her NICHOLAS MCBRIDE Last updated 16:45, August 12 2016 
A man who tricked a petrol station attendant into opening late at night so his friend could rob her is off to jail. 
Joshua Larsen, 22, of Foxton, was sentenced to 15 months in prison for helping to rob the Foxton Mobil petrol station on December 6. 
He was sentenced in Palmerston North District Court on Friday. 
Judge Stephanie Edwards said Larsen drove a friend, who was not named, to the station at 2.30am with the intention of robbing it. 
Larsen knew the sole attendant, as he was a regular customer, and convinced her to open the doors. A report also revealed he had gone to school with her children. 
The judge said when Larsen left the station, his friend walked in and attempted to rob it, brandishing a 20cm-long knife. 
He demanded money and tobacco from the attendant and tried using the knife to pry open the cash drawer. 
The judge said Larsen&apos;s friend left with &quot;a quantity of tobacco&quot;. 
Larsen admitted his involvement but would not name his co-offender. 
Judge Edwards said Larsen abused the woman&apos;s trust. 
&quot;You were a regular customer in a small community, it was the reason she opened the door to you.&quot; 
In a victim impact statement, the woman said she was afraid of being physically harmed. 
Restorative justice was not an option because the woman &quot;understandably&quot; did not want to participate, the judge said. 
Larsen was subject to supervision at the time of the robbery. 
The judge said it was a second-strike offence, following a stabbing he committed when 19. 
A sentencing report stated Larsen expressed remorse. - Stuff
