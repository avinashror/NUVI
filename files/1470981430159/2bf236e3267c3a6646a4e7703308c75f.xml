Spain defeats China 89-68 in women’s basketball Group B Spain defeats China 89-68 in women&apos;s basketball Group B NBC Olympics.com Published: Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) 
Alba Torrens proved to be too much for the Chinese squad to handle as Torrens led Spain to a 89-68 win in their Group B matchup. 
Both teams entered the match with a win and a loss in group, play but Spain came away with their second victory of the Rio Olympics thanks to a lopsided fourth quarter performance. 
China trailed by just five after three quarters, but was held to just nine points in the final frame compared to Spain’s 25. 
Torrens was the linchpin for Spain, scoring 32 points, to go along with nine rebounds, four assists and a steal. Astou Ndour added 21 points and five rebounds. 
Every player who saw floor-time scored for China, but just two reached double figures. Shao Ting scored a team-high 14 points. 
The win puts Spain in good position to move on to the quarterfinals, while China will need to win one of their next two games to ensure a spot in the knockout round. China plays Serbia (0-2) on Friday and then the United States (2-0) on Sunday. Spain plays Senegal on Friday. Share this:
