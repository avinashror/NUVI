Veteran industry leader and consultant Rod Abraham will take over as executive director of the Senior Planners Industry Network, a 3,000-plus-member organization founded in 2008 to serve the needs of planners with at least 10 years of experience in the industry. He replaces Mike Vennerstrom, CMP, who had served as interim executive director since January. 
SPIN founder Shawna Suckow says of the appointment, “SPIN is ready to move to the next level of growth and value to both our planner members and our supplier partners. I know Rod has the industry experience, reputation, relationships, and business savvy to help us do that.” 
Abraham has a long and distinguished history in the meeting planning community. A charter member of Meeting Professionals International, he has twice served as chair of the MPI Foundation board of trustees. Abraham has also been a member of the MPI international board of directors, and served as trustee of the Society for Incentive Travel Excellence Foundation. He also has received many accolades for his work, including MPI’s first Appreciation Award and MPI International Planner of the Year. His professional career includes founding PMPN, the Professional Meeting Planners Network, which was recently renamed PlannerNet, as well as serving as PMPN’s chief executive. 
“I am excited, energized, and anxious to get started,” says Abraham of his latest career move. “I look forward to working with Shawna, her team, and the many volunteer leaders whose commitment has achieved an impressive foundation for future growth.”
