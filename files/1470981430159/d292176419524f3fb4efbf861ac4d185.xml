THERE’S not a lot left for Orange Wanderers to play for this men’s Premier League Hockey season, with the finals now out of reach. 
But that doesn’t mean Matt Johnson’s men are about to let Bathurst City get one over them in 2016. 
Wanderers have accounted for the lowly ranked City outfit on each of the two occasions the sides have met this season, the 10-0 and 6-2 victories some of the best hockey the Orange club has played throughout the winter. 
Wanderers will head to Bob Roach Field as the firm favourites as a result, but City’s Mal Willott believes his side is primed for an upset on Saturday. 
“They can’t make the finals, so that might change the game a bit, they don’t have that to play for anymore,” Willott said. 
“The last time we played Wanderers I wasn’t there, but a couple of guys said we played really good and had a lot of shots that day too. 
“I think it’s a team we’ve been competitive against in most of our games. I know they beat us 10-0 in one game, but that was in Orange and their turf in Orange, well it’s different to play on.” Saturday’s penultimate round clash in Bathurst begins at 3.20pm. Latest News
