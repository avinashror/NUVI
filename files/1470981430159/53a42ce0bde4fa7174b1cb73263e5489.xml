Datsun to re-enter Sri Lanka with redi-Go; sales to commence in September August 12, 2016 11:17 IST By Greeshma M Datsun to re-enter Sri Lanka with redi-Go. Pictured: Datsun redi-Go Datsun India/news 
Datsun, the Japanese auto-maker Nissan&apos;s low-cost brand, is in an expansion mode and the company is all set to re-enter the Sri Lankan market in September. Datsun announced that the firm would make a comeback to Sri Lanka next month with its all new hatchback, the redi-Go. 
Datsun, which entered Sri Lanka in 1957, had withdrawn from the market in 1986 after 29 years. The car will be offered through the dealer network of Nissan&apos;s long-time partner in Sri Lanka, Associated Motorways (Private) Ltd. (AMW). Datsun recently also announced its re-introduction in Lebanon. 
&quot;The return of Datsun to Sri Lanka is a key element of our expansion in fast-growing markets where there is growing demand for personal mobility,&quot; Vincent Cobee, the Global Head of Datsun, said. &quot;Datsun&apos;s key values — Dream, Access and Trust — are designed to accommodate the needs and aspirations of up-and-coming customers who seek attractive styling, modern engineering, worry-free ownership, and an engaging driving experience. We are delighted to return to Sri Lanka with Datsun redi-Go to expand our offer in the largest vehicle market segment to a new generation of Sri Lankan customers who are ready for something new and exciting.&quot; 
Datsun launched the redi-Go in India in June and the hatchback has been making remarkable sales in the market, as compared to the previous two offerings of the company, the Go and the Go+. The redi-Go, which is built on the same CMF-A platform as the Renault Kwid, has been priced at Rs. 2.38 lakh for the base variant (ex-showroom, Delhi). It offers segment-leading ground clearance of 185mm and comes with a boot space of 222-litre. 
Datsun redi-Go, the entry level hatchback, is pitted against front-runners in the segment like Maruti Alto 800, Hyundai Eon and Renault Kwid in India. Under the hood of Datsun&apos;s new offering is a 799cc three-cylinder petrol motor that churns out 53bhp and a peak torque of 72Nm. The redi-Go claims to return a fuel efficiency of 25.17kmpl.
