U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt flew into the Joplin Regional Airport on Thursday with National Rifle Association leaders to urge about 50 supporters who had assembled in the Alpha Air Center to keep working hard to re-elect the Republican in November. 
Wayne LaPierre, CEO of the NRA, and Chris Cox, the NRA&apos;s executive director of its lobbying arm, endorsed Blunt against opponent Jason Kander, Missouri&apos;s Democratic secretary of state. Blunt has an A rating with the group. 
All three said the election&apos;s results would have an influence on the next Supreme Court nominee. After the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, the Supreme Court is split 4-4 in its perceived leanings. 
&quot;This is not about a four-year presidential term or even a six-year Senate term; it&apos;s about a 25- to 30-year majority on the Supreme Court,&quot; Blunt said. &quot;Freedom really is in the balance.&quot; 
Most Republican senators, including Blunt, have refused to meet with, let alone vote on, President Barack Obama&apos;s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland. Although there are 54 Republican U.S. senators, the unpredictability of the current election cycle could mean a lost majority. 
Blunt&apos;s visit to Joplin came on the back of comments made by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump regarding the Second Amendment and the fight for the Supreme Court. Story continues below video 
During a rally, Trump joked that after Hillary Clinton is voted into office, making her able to pick a new Supreme Court justice, &quot;Second Amendment people&quot; would be able to do &quot;something&quot; about it. Many thought he insinuated violence against Clinton. The U.S. Secret Service said it was aware of his comment. Trump, who has been endorsed by the NRA and Blunt, clarified he was talking about gun advocates&apos; power in voting, though Clinton would have already been voted into office in his scenario. 
&quot;What Donald Trump expressed was his opinion that what we do between now and Election Day to elect him president will have a major impact on the rights of law-abiding gun owners in the country based on the Supreme Court,&quot; Cox said of the comment, adding, &quot;What Donald Trump said is gun owners and Second Amendment supporters would be critical in this election.&quot; 
In an interview with the Globe, Cox said the NRA would never endorse the idea of the shooting Clinton, describing it as &quot;absurd.&apos;&apos; 
A Blunt supporter at the event said Trump&apos;s comment was blown out of proportion and misconstrued. 
&quot;He just needs to learn how to keep his mouth shut,&quot; said Susan Lamb, of Neosho. 
Missouri&apos;s contest has been called one of the key races to watch the election. Though the incumbent, Blunt is leading Kander by only a few points, according to recent polls. As of July 15, Public Polling Policy puts the race at 41-38, claiming the nearly even split is because of Blunt&apos;s unpopularity. A poll conducted by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in August placed Blunt in the lead in a 47-44 split. Sign Up / Sign In With your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}
