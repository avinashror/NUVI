More Republicans are distancing themselves from Donald Trump. Evan Vucci by Ginger Gibson and Steve Holland Republican Donald Trump called President Barack Obama and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton the &quot;co-founders&quot; of Islamic State, ratcheting up his assertion that they are responsible for the rise of the militant group and sparking renewed criticism of his leadership ability.
Clinton&apos;s White House campaign on Thursday called the remarks a &quot;false claim,&quot; in Ms Clinton&apos;s latest response to a series of attacks by Mr Trump in which he has sought to portray America as less safe, blaming Democrats and depicting himself as the only one who can restore security.
Democrats, in turn, have used Mr Trump&apos;s often hyperbolic statements to argue that he is unfit to be president and lacks the temperament to be trusted with matters of national security.
&quot;This is another example of Donald Trump trash-talking the United States,&quot; Ms Clinton senior policy adviser Jake Sullivan said in a statement.
&quot;What&apos;s remarkable about Trump&apos;s comments is that once again he&apos;s echoing the talking points of Putin and our adversaries to attack American leaders and American interests, while failing to offer any serious plans to confront terrorism or make this country more secure,&quot; Mr Sullivan said, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
 For Republicans uncertain about whether Mr Trump has the discipline to maintain focus for his campaign, the latest comments were concerning. Many see the New York real estate mogul as spending too much time fighting within his own party and have called on him to refocus his campaign message on Ms Clinton.
&quot;Trump should have simply said that the Obama administration&apos;s decision to pull all troops out of Iraq, with no stay-behind agreement, created a vacuum and allowed ISIS to metastasise. It&apos;s absurd for him to say that Obama and Clinton are founders of ISIS - and he can&apos;t blame the media for this,&quot; said Alice Stewart, a Republican strategist who remains undecided about the nominee.
A group of about 70 Republicans called on the Republican National Committee to stop helping Mr Trump in the wake of his recent remarks and instead focus on getting members of Congress re-elected.
&quot;[Mr] Trump&apos;s divisive and dangerous actions are not only a threat to our other candidates, but to our party and the nation,&quot; the letter stated.
In response, Mr Trump said he would stop raising money for the Republican Party if it ends its help for his campaign.
&quot;If they want to do that they can save me a lot of time and a lot of energy,&quot; he told Fox News. &quot;I&apos;m the one raising the money for them.&quot;
