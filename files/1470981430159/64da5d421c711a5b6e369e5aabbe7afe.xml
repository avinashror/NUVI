On a night when everyone started out talking about Michael Phelps, it was another young swimmer who made American history.
20-year-old Simone Manuel became the first black female swimmer to win an Olympic medal for America when she tied for first place in the 100m freestyle.
HIGHLIGHTS: Simone Manuel, Penny Oleksiak tie for gold in 100m freestyle
In the last few meters, Manuel caught up to Australian favorite Cate Campbell and touched the wall at 52.70, dead even with Canadian Penny Oleksiak.
An emotional Manuel was in tears in her post race interview as the historic nature of her win caught up to her.
&quot;All I can say is all glory to God,&quot; Manuel said. &quot;It&apos;s definitely been a long journey these past four years, and I&apos;m just so blessed to have the gold medal.&quot;
