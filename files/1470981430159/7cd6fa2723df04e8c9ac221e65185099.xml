No Record Of Instructor Certification In Deadly Lodi Skydiving Accident Posted on August 11, 2016 
FRESNO (KMJ) – Questions about that deadly sky diving accident near Lodi – was the instructor certified? According to the United States Parachute Association, they have no record of certification for 25 year-old instructor Yong Kwon as reported by the Sacramento Bee – that’s a violation of federal regulations. Kwon and first-time jumper Tyler Turner died Saturday, August 6th after a tandem sky-dive from a plane operating out of the Parachute Center in Acampo. Their parachute did not open and Kwon and the 18 year old UC Merced student from Los Banos hit the ground. The Sacramento Bee reports Bill Dause, owner of the Parachute Center, says Kwon was certified by an instructor – with Dause saying; “there’s been confusion about that.” Dause had previously told the Associated Press that Kwon was a veteran skydiver with more than 700 jumps.
