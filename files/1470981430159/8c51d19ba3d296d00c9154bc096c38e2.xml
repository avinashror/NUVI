Have Fun at the Nature Center’s Monarchs &amp; Margaritas August 11th, 2016 
Contributed Article 
Audubon Nature Center For a sneak peek preview of the Monarch Butterfly Festival and some grown-up fun, you are invited to the Audubon Nature Center’s Monarchs &amp; Margaritas on Friday evening, August 26. As naturalist Katie Finch, pictured here, learned, it’s a delightful way to enjoy a drink in the company of some of the butterflies. Jamestown, NY – You are invited to a festive time at the Audubon Nature Center’s Monarchs &amp; Margaritas. At this adults-only event, you can treat yourself to an evening with grown-ups and butterflies! On Friday, August 26, the Nature Center will be prepared for the next day’s Monarch Butterfly Festival with an indoor butterfly garden full of beautiful flowers and Monarch butterflies. From 5-7 p.m. you can enjoy an exclusive sneak peek of the Festival and have special fun while you support the Monarch butterflies as they prepare for their migration to Mexico. Each admission includes two margaritas, appetizers, a crowd-free/child-free experience with the live butterflies, and a chance to win some great prizes. Miley’s is providing the drinks and catering south-of-the-border-themed appetizers with vegetarian options. Non-alcoholic beverages will also be available. Monarchs need help. During the last decade, their numbers have been decimated by habitat loss, deforestation, and drought. Through a fun game and the opportunity to view all stages of the Monarch life cycle up close, you will learn more about their plight and how you can help. So come on down: bring your friends and enjoy the food and drinks as well as the butterflies and fun. A hint for first-timers: Bring some spare change for extra drinks, to get ahead in the game, and to shop for some great butterfly-themed merchandise. Reserve early: admission is limited. Cost is $25 for those who reserve and pay by Wednesday, August 26, or $30 at the door. Register and pay by phone with a credit card at (716) 569-2345 or online by clicking under “Monarchs &amp; Margaritas” at www.jamestownaudubon.org . The Audubon Nature Center is at 1600 Riverside Road, one-quarter mile east of Route 62 between Jamestown, New York, and Warren, Pennsylvania. The Nature Center building, with its live animals, exhibits, and Blue Heron Gift Shop, is open daily. Outdoors are the Bald Eagle viewing, arboretum, picnic tables, gardens, and five miles of trails.
