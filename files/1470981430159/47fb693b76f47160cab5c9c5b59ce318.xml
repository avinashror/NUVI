14 Arrested in Trafficking Bust in Tulare County Posted on August 11, 2016 
TULARE COUNTY, CA (KMJ) – A large human trafficking ring was taken down in Tulare County. The sheriff’s office says the sex trade ring has been going on for the past 3-4 years. “Operation Baby Face” discovered 50 victims, some as young as 14 years of age. 
The suspects created a false persona on social media with a female photo asking victims to be friends and then grooming them for eventual sexual exploitation. The girls would be lured by trying to be “friends” with the fake profile, and eventually coercing the girls to send inappropriate photos. When the girls would try to cut off contact, the fake social media profile would make threats to send the inappropriate photos to others. 
There were 3 ringleaders and 11 co-conspirators arrested in the bust. Sheriff Mike Boudreaux says the cyber crimes unit was even led to a Tulare County corrections officer. That officer, who was not identified, was put on paid administrative leave pending an investigation. 
70 officers were involved in the take down. The cyber crimes unit is still going through files and more arrests are possible. Two suspects, are still on the loose. They may be accompanied by a 16 year old girl. 
Please contact law enforcement if you discover something suspicious. Tulare County Sheriff’s Office: (559) 733-6218 or anonymously through TipNow at (559) 725-4194 or tcso@tipnow.com.
