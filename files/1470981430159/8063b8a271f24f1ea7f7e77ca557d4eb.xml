Lukas Krpalek nabbed the Czech Republic&apos;s first-ever Olympic judo medal, throwing Azerbaijan’s Elmar Gasimov to win gold in the under-100 kilogram division.
Krpalek, the 2014 world champion, shocked Gasimov in the final match on August 11, using a throw called the maximum ippon to defeat him.
Czechoslovakia won a bronze medal in the 1980 Games in Moscow boycotted by many Western nations, but this was the Czechs&apos; first judo medal since separating from Slovakia.
The Czech had earlier ousted the reigning world champion Ryunosuke Haga of Japan, who defeated Ukraine&apos;s Artem Bloshenko to claim the bronze medal. Cyrille Maret of France won the other bronze.
In women&apos;s fencing, Ana Maria Popescu fended off a charging Anqi Xu of China to win gold for Romania, the country’s first medal at the Rio games.
In team competition, Russia beat Estonia 37-31 to claim bronze and an Olympic-leading fifth fencing medal.
In women&apos;s gymnastics, Americans Simone Biles and Ally Raisman won gold and silver in the all-around competition on August 11.
Russia&apos;s Aliya Mustafina&apos;s floor routine set to the timeless tune of &quot;Moscow Nights&quot; helped her win bronze
Russia&apos;s women&apos;s team pocketed silver at the team gymnastics finals on August 9.
Russian swimmers powered to Olympic silver and bronze on August 11. Yulia Yefimova won silver in the 200 meter backstroke while Yevgeny Rylov nabbed a bronze in the men&apos;s event.
Yefimova, who was disqualified for 16 months from October 2013 to February 2015 after testing positive for an anabolic steroid, has found herself at the center of fierce controversy in Rio.
Yefimova was defeated by her American rival Lilly King in the 100 meter breaststroke on August 8 and was loudly booed by the Rio crowd.
She was jeered again before the August 11 race as she came out wearing headphones.
Meanwhile, American swimmer Michael Phelps grabbed his 13th individual gold medal, and the 22nd gold overall in his career, winning the 200 meter individual medley.
The victory on August 11 is also Phelps 26th medal overall, making him one of the most decorated Olympic athletes ever.
The 31-year-old edged out Japan&apos;s Kosuke Hagino and China&apos;s Wang Shun, who won silver and bronze respectively.
He also powered past his longtime rival and teammate Ryan Lochte, who has 12 medals to his name, including six golds.
The win makes him the third Olympian to win the same individual event at four straight games, joining the ranks of discus thrower Al Oerter and long jumper Carl Lewis.
