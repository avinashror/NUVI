Ordinance: You could pay a $200 fine if you walk on closed fields at Veterans Park College Station Veterans Park fines surprise residents. Ian Smith, KAGS 11:28   CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST 
COLLEGE STATION, Texas - Signs at a popular at a popular sporting venue are catching some people by surprise. At Veterans Park, you could pay hundreds in fines if you disregard the signs that are warning people to stay out of certain areas. 
&quot;No, I&apos;ve never seen it before,&quot; said Sean Beery, who was playing football one a field with some friends. &quot;I&apos;ve came here for practice and everything and never saw it or anything.&quot; 
Beery said another group mentioned the sign but he didn&apos;t think much of it. 
&quot;They said they were going to use the turf and for us to get on the grass, and they told us to expect to get kicked off by the city.&quot; 
We spotted several signs at the park and at least three fields were closed. The signs say specific soccer fields are closed and violators could be charged a fine of $200. 
The fine stems for Ordinance 1322, which was established in 1981. Beery said the signs need to be a little more front and center. 
&quot;It&apos;s behind the restrooms. It&apos;s like, it&apos;s relatively small,&quot; he said. 
The city&apos;s parks and recreations director said he wants people to stay off of the grass so they aren&apos;t exposed to fertilizer. The signs are also common at parks across the city as maintenance takes place. 
Another ordinance, passed in 1967, makes it unlawful to tamper with foliage at city parks. 
Lately, the gates at Veterans Park have been left open while the park is closed. This is due to people becoming trapped in the park while playing Pokemon Go.
