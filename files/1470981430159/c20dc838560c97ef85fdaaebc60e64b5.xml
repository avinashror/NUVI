The day Houston gymnast Simone Biles won gold, the Astros swung some golden bats Email Print By Chris Landers | 
On Thursday afternoon, the 2016 Summer Olympics officially became the Simone Biles show: After helping the U.S. take home team gold earlier in the week, the 19-year-old became just the fifth American to take home the women&apos;s individual all-around gold. 
Of course, if you wanted to know whether or not Biles was the best gymnast in the world, you could&apos;ve just asked an Astros fan. During the team&apos;s 2-1 win over the Mariners back on July 4, Biles -- a Houston native -- was scheduled to throw out the first pitch ... and proceeded to do this: 
No doubt inspired by their new hometown hero, the Astros delivered a gold medal performance of their own in their doubleheader against the Twins: Two games, two wins, 29 hits, 25 runs. Jose Altuve paced Houston in a 15-7 matinee win , going 4-for-5, driving in three and scoring three runs. The nightcap, though, was all Carlos Correa -- who hit a home run to center in the 10-2 victory that just might have escaped Earth&apos;s Orbit. 
So congratulations to both Simone and the &apos;Stros, the furry green alien judge gives you a perfect 10. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs. more from cut4
