SAN DIEGO (AP) – A California woman with ALS, or Lou Gehrig’s disease, held a two-day party for her friends and relatives to say goodbye before taking her life with a dose of prescribed drugs. 
Betsy Davis, 41, became one of the first Californians to make use a new state law allowing doctor-assisted suicide. Four other states have such laws, with Oregon the first in 1997. 
Davis shared her plans with her guests, giving them a detailed schedule for the weekend that included the hour she planned to slip into a coma. 
There were cocktails. There was pizza from her favorite local joint. There was a screening of one of her favorite movies. And then her friends said their goodbyes and left. 
She had one rule, no crying. 
Davis was wheeled out to a canopy bed on a hillside and took her own life. Share this:
