The earthquake struck about 535 kilometres offshore of the islands of Vanuatu, at a depth of 10 kilometres, officials said. by Matt Siegel A major earthquake with a magnitude of 7.2 struck about 535 km southeast of the South Pacific island nation of Vanuatu on Friday, the US Geological Survey said, briefly triggering a local tsunami warning.
There were no initial reports of casualties or damage.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre issued a warning for areas close to the quake, although there was no Pacific-wide threat of a tsunami, the Hawaii-based centre said. The shallow quake was measured at a depth of about 10 km.
The quake initially registered with a magnitude of 7.6 but was later downgraded. The tsunami warning, which had included coastal areas of Vanuatu, New Caledonia and Fiji, including the Fijian capital, Suva, was later cancelled.
The powerful quake triggered at least one aftershock, with a magnitude of 5.4, the USGS said.
