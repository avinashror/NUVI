Donald Trump suggests trying Americans at Guantanamo Bay CBS News 1 hr ago Emily Schultheis Â© REUTERS/Eric Thayer 2016-08-09t234527z481093163s1betunnkxaartrmadp3usa-election-trump.jpg Donald Trump suggested in an interview Thursday that he might allow Americans accused of terrorism to be tried at the Guantanamo Bay detention center in Cuba.
&quot;Well, I know that they want to try them in our regular court systems, and I don&apos;t like that at all, I don&apos;t like that at all,&quot; he told the Miami Herald. &quot;I would say they could be tried there, that&apos;ll be fine.&quot;
Current federal law prohibits U.S. citizens from being tried in military tribunals. Of Guantanamo, Trump has previously suggested he would &quot;load it up with bad dudes.&quot;
&quot;I want to make sure that if we have radical Islamic terrorists, we have a very safe place to keep &apos;em and we have a word, those are words our president won&apos;t even issue,&quot; he said. &quot;He&apos;s allowing people to get out that are terrible people. He&apos;s allowing a lot of people out of Guantanamo that should not be released.&quot;
Trump has come under fire for other comments he&apos;s made recently on the topic of terrorism -- namely his suggestion Wednesday night that President Obama is &quot;the founder of ISIS.&quot;
&quot;I will tell you that as far as Guantanamo is concerned I want to make sure, 100 percent sure, that if we&apos;re going to release people, number one they&apos;re going to be people that can be released and it&apos;s going to be safe to release them and there are plenty of bad ones out there and I&apos;d use it for that,&quot; Trump continued.
