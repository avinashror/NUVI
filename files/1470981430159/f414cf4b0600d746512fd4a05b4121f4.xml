By Mike Sloan Aug 11, 2016 Heavyweight contender Travis Browne has coveted a rematch with former world champion Fabricio Werdum ever since he lost to the Brazilian via decision back on the UFC on Fox 11 card two years ago. It looks like he’ll get his wish granted on Sep. 10 at UFC 203 . With Ben Rothwell having been removed from the pay-per-view event due to an injury, Browne has opted to step in on late notice to try and exact revenge on “Vai Cavalo.” MMAjunkie.com first reported the news; UFC officials have not yet officially announced the move. Browne is coming off a first-round TKO loss at the hands of former champ Cain Velasquez at UFC 200. Before that, “Hapa” had flip-flopped between wins and losses, having gone 2-2 in his last four before facing Velasquez. Werdum, meanwhile, is coming off a knockout loss to Stipe Miocic at UFC 198 this past May. UFC 203 will be headlined by reigning heavyweight champion Miocic defending his title for the first time against former K-1 World Grand Prix champion Alistair Overeem . UFC 203 will take place inside Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio and will be televised live on UFC Fight Pass, Fox Sports 1 and pay-per-view.
