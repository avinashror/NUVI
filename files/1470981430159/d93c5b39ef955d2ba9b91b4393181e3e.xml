BRADFORD TOWNSHIP, Minn. - A recently executed search warrant resulted in criminal charges and arrests, after officers discovered methamphetamine, stolen property from 15 burglaries and 32 firearms -- many that were stolen. 
Authorities with the Isanti County Sheriff&apos;s Office, with the help of the East Central Drug and Violent Offender Task Force, executed a search warrant on Aug. 8 at a residence in Bradford Township. 
In the course of the highly extensive search, which lasted three days, authorities found several items from recent burglaries and numerous firearms. During the investigation, four of those weapons were found to be stolen. 
Five people were arrested and so far, two have been charged -- 45-year-old Fredrik Keith Kalumaina Koerte, of Minneapolis, was charged with fifth-degree drug possession and two counts of possession of a firearm as a felon and 61-year-old Marcus Jeffrey Lucas, of Isanti, was charged with 21 counts of possessing a firearm as a felon, third-degree possession of narcotics and three counts of receiving stolen property. 
Officials say the owners of the stolen property have been contacted but because of the amount seized, the case remains open and more charges are possible.
