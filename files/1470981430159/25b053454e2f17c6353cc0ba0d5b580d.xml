Perseid meteor shower peaks this week Written by CBS 5 on Tue, Aug 9 View Comments 
The Perseid meteor shower&apos;s peak will start lighting up the night sky this week and the weather conditions for northern Arizona are looking pretty good. 
According to the National Weather Service, there are good viewing conditions across most of the northern part of the state with the best areas from the Flagstaff area toward the north and the west. Those spots include Page and Winslow. 
Fair conditions are expected around areas like Show Low and Window rock. 
The Perseid meteor shower, associated with the comet Swift–Tuttle, is the shooting-star show that happens each year in August. NASA is predicting the Perseid &quot;outburst&quot; this year will double the normal rates on Aug. 11 and 12. Some astronomers believe that could mean 150 meteors per hour, while others have a higher estimate of up to 200 meteors per hour. 
Astronomers say the shooting stars will originate from the constellation Perseus and will be the most visible after midnight. They can appear all over the sky but will always look like they&apos;re streaking away from the constellation. 
The bright moon washes out some of the meteors so the best time to look for them will be after moonset. The moon sets just after 12:30 a.m. in Arizona. Author: CBS 5
