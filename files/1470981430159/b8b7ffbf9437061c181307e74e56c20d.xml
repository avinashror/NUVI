comments David Villa lauds A-League standard In an interview with Omnisport, Spain&apos;s all-time leading goalscorer David Villa reflected on his time in the A-League. 
Albeit a brief stint in Australia, New York City captain David Villa remembers his time in the A-League fondly, with the Spanish star striker still keeping a keen interest in Melbourne City. 
Before playing a competitive game for MLS expansion franchise New York City, Spain&apos;s all-time leading goalscorer was sent to sister club Melbourne - a subsidiary of the City Football Group - as a guest player, scoring two goals in four appearances. 
While his time Down Under was short-lived, the World Cup, European Championship, Champions League and LaLiga winner was left impressed by the standard of the A-League. 
&quot;It&apos;s a good league. It is growing. It is competitive,&quot; Villa told Omnisport. 
&quot;I enjoyed my time there. I&apos;m very happy to have had the experience. 
&quot;I watch sometimes. It is difficult because of the time difference – but I like watching the Melbourne City games.&quot; 
Villa made an instant impact in Australia, scoring on debut before backing that up with a goal in his second match for the club. 
Since then, the 34-year-old has gone on to score 31 goals in almost two full seasons for New York City. 
Villa - a two-time MLS All-Star - has scored 13 goals in 23 appearances this season for the Eastern Conference leaders. SHARES
