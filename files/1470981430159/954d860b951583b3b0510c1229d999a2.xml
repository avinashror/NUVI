Bharli vangi or stuffed brinjals 

This is very simple and easy recipe for bharli vangi. It is also one of my favorite dish from childhood. My mother makes it especially for me. Post marriage whenever i go to visit her she makes it to make me happy on day one itself. Bharli vangi and batatyacha rassa are two my favorite recipe in veg. I’m big fan of her non veg recipe as well. 


She sent me kanda lasun chatni along with one Paithani in last month. This is first recipe which I made with new chatni and obviously it became delicious…. Thanks aai. 
This recipe is quick and easy as well as spicy. It is typical Maharashtrian recipe. I am Satarkar, so one can say that this recipe from Satara or west Maharashtra.

STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS WITH PICTURES 
Ingredients we need for this recipe small brinjals, peanut powder, chopped onion, kanda lasun chatni and salt to taste. 

Choosing brinjals is a skill too. It should be small, few inches long, round shaped like an egg. Also tryto search one with smooth, purple skin streaked with white and a green calyx brinjals. 
If those are not available then you can also make this recipe with dark purple brinjal. But I prefer test of brinjals which I mentioned above.
