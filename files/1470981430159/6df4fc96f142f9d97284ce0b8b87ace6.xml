Letter: Vialpando killing   11:30PM Although I live in Los Angeles, over 825 miles from Pueblo, I read with sadness of the senseless shooting death of Isaiah Vialpando in September 2015. I am not a crime investigator but as a former street and prison gang member, I recognize the fingerprints of a random street shooting. Warring street factions generally know the identity of their rivals but there are many who seek honor, recognition and approval from their underworld peers by consciously preying on innocent people. There is no glory attached to the attack on the defenseless in our society. Pure and simple, it is the work of a coward, unworthy of any accolades, even from fellow gang members. I know. As a teenage gang member, I killed for my neighborhood, was arrested and convicted many years ago. But we in the Chicano gang underworld navigated away from targeting innocent people because there was no glory in such an undertaking and we all have innocent siblings who were not part of our gang world. Vialpando could have been my younger brother — seeking a path in life that was straight and honorable. More importantly, for those of you from Pueblo, Vialpando could have been your little brother. Think about that as you consider your community’s destiny. Picture the police coming to your doorstep and sadly disclosing that your child, brother or relative was murdered as he came home from school. Do the right thing.
