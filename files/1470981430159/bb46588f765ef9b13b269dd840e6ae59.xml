Rebuilding trust and valuing employees are among the most important tasks for a new Joplin School District superintendent, participants in several focus groups said Thursday. 
The focus groups were scheduled across two days this week for key stakeholder groups by Ray and Associates Inc., the firm hired by the Board of Education to help guide the search for the next superintendent. Groups providing their input Thursday included teachers; bus drivers; staff in the building, grounds and transportation department; food service personnel; and community leaders. 
Nearly 10 teachers in the first focus group of the day were quick to list the strengths of the district. The staff is dedicated, and technology is well-integrated into classrooms, they said. The district also offers a variety of extracurricular activities to students, they said. 
When the search firm asked for qualities, traits or characteristics that the next superintendent should have, the teacher group easily poured out its list: involved, trustworthy, dedicated, experienced, an active listener. 
&quot;I feel like you need to hear the teacher voice and respect it,&quot; said Crystal Stokes, a middle school teacher. 
Teachers overwhelmingly said that rebuilding trust would be the top issue facing a new superintendent upon his or her arrival. They pointed to low morale among staff, high teacher turnover rates and salaries that are lower than those of surrounding districts as additional issues that would need to be addressed. 
&quot;We need a strong leader who is going to do what&apos;s best for our students, teachers and staff,&quot; said Stokes, adding that the ideal superintendent also would provide his or her employees with adequate resources and genuine praise. Story continues below video 
A small group of staff members from the building, grounds and transportation department provided its own list of ideal qualities for a superintendent: integrity, transparency, intelligence, humility. They said they were looking for an individual who would &quot;build bridges&quot; between the school district and the community as well as someone who would value support staff and the role they play in schools. 
&quot;You have to know who people are to build relationships,&quot; said David Pettit, director of transportation. &quot;At least to know you work for the district and know your name, that&apos;s a huge deal.&quot; 
Brenda Dietrich, of Ray and Associates, told one of the focus groups that she recently finished a superintendent search in Rogers, Arkansas, that had drawn 62 applicants. A former superintendent in Kansas, she said she was recruited by the search firm from Massachusetts to her last position, where she stayed for 14 years. 
&quot;This is a good district,&quot; she said. &quot;I think you&apos;re going to have a good pool of candidates.&quot; 
Timeline 
The information collected during the focus groups will be given to the Joplin Board of Education on Aug. 23 and used to build a candidate profile that will be advertised with the position. Applications will be due in mid-September; an individual could be named to the position by the first week of November. Sign Up / Sign In With your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}
