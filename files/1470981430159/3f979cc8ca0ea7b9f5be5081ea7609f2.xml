After years of staying open despite deterioration and major structural problems, Tampa&apos;s code enforcement has declared the building, located on Florida Avenue near Nebraska Avenue, unfit for human habitation. Demolition started Thursday morning on the 100-year-old building. Pastor Pat Hall said she is devastated. Hall has held services in the building for 40 years and helped shelter and feed the homeless. In addition to the building being torn down, Hall said the church has no place to go to relocate.&quot;We love this location, we’ve been here 40-something years,&quot; Hall said. &quot;We used to have 500 people here, we used to be on public access television.&quot; The building&apos;s structural problems were compounded in July 2015 when a drunk driver crashed through the front door of the church. The crash left a gaping hole - both literally and figuratively. But the church had faced financial issues for years and had been trying to raise funds to repair the rundown building. At one point last year, the city gave the church an extension on getting repairs done. That time has come and gone now. And the city of Tampa is charging the church $53,000 in demolition costs. Hall said the church does have a building fund but they have not received any significant donations.
