NORTHAMPTON, Mass. (WWLP) – A Northampton police officer drew his gun in order to get a suspect to drop a knife during a disturbance in a park Tuesday night. 
That suspect, 31 year-old Alex Lesieur of Springfield, is now being charged with disorderly conduct (subsequent offense) and carrying a dangerous weapon. 
Northampton Police Capt. John Cartledge told 22News that around 5:10 that night, two bicycle officers at Pulaski Park noticed a disturbance involving six people. Cartledge said that one of the six (later identified as Lesieur) was carrying a knife. 
Cartledge said that Lesieur turned toward one of the officers while still holding a knife, and walked a short ways toward him. The officer pulled out his gun, and Lesieur promptly dropped the knife. He was then placed under arrest. Share this:
