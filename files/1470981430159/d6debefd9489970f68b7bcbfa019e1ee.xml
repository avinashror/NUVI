Trainer on Lewis: &quot;The Kid Had a Huge Smile and a Huge Heart&quot; Lewis Simpkins was a member of the Gators football team. Chuck Ringwalt, wltx 7:24 PM. EST August 11, 2016 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST 
Lexington, SC (WLTX) - One of kind. That’s how some are describing Lewis Simpkins. 
On Wednesday, the River Bluff high school student suddenly died during his team’s football practice. According to the Lexington Coroner, the initial autopsy results are inconclusive . 
But Simpkins&apos; legacy lives on. 
“His smile. I mean I know that’s cliché, but the kid had a huge smile and a huge heart,&quot; Jason Brunson said. 
Brunson was Simpkins&apos; personal trainer.“Lewis comes into the gym and you feel like you’ve known him forever,” Brunson said. “He was a kid, a very mature kid, but he’s still a kid that had hopes and dreams of doing all of these great things.” Over the last two years, the pair trained together and created a bond. He said they would talk about baseball, football and Simpkins’ goal of becoming a Tiger and playing in Death Valley.“I don’t think I ever saw him without any Clemson gear on and that was his passion. He wanted to play football at Clemson,” Brunson said. He said it’s no surprise to see such an outpouring of love from the community.“I’ve had so many kids text me in the past twelve hours who he just trained with. I’m sure he’s social media friends with them, but it’s not like he was an everyday acquaintance with them, but they’ve all texted me out of the blue, talking about how good of a guy Lewis was. I’ve had parents even call who would just watch Lewis from afar,” he said. But Brunson said he hopes everyone will continue to support Lewis’ family.“You’ve just got to think about Shonda, his mother and Willy his father and the rest of their family at this time because they’re the ones who really need all of the support in the world. Every time I think of him I just think he was an old soul. An old soul kid. They just don’t come around like him,” he said. 
The district says the River Bluff football team will not participate in the Sportsarama that they were scheduled to play in Friday.
