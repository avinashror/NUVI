Play stops in Ravens preseason game for Michael Phelps race NBC Olympics.com Published: Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) 
The Baltimore Ravens stopped play in their preseason game against the Carolina Panthers so fans at M &amp; T Bank Stadium could watch Michael Phelps win his 22nd gold medal. 
All eyes in the stadium, including those of the players and referees, turned to the RavensVision scoreboard as it aired NBC’s live coverage of the 2016 Rio Olympics. 
Phelps defeated Ryan Lochte, among others, in the 200-meter individual medley final on Thursday night. 
The greatest Olympic athlete of all-time happens to be a Baltimore native and life-long Ravens fan. 
His hometown NFL team also aired one of Phelps’ golden races from Beijing in a 2008 preseason game. Share this:
