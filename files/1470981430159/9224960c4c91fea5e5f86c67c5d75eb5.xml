ORANGE’S Edwina Bone and Parkes’ Mariah Williams helped their Hockeyroos move one step closer to a quarter-final spot with back-to-back wins over India and then Argentina on Thursday and Friday (AEST) respectively. 
After almost disastrous Games-opening losses to Great Britain and the USA, both 2-1, the Hockeyroos bounced back by flogging the Indians 6-1 before producing a remarkable performance to down the No.2 ranked Argentinians on, essentially, their home turf. 
A victory in their final preliminary fixture against Japan on Sunday looks likely to seal third spot in Group B for the Australians which, crucially, should help the side avoid a final eight showdown with the Netherlands, the reigning Olympic champions. 
A relieving thought for the Australian-side no doubt, although Hockeyroos coach Adam Commens remains adamant his side is capable of beating any side, including the all-conquering Dutch. 
“The (Olympics) are wide open. We are not afraid of any team in the cross-overs, even though the Netherlands are the Olympic and world champions. If we play our best we can beat them,” Commens fired after the win over India, before saying his side is only just starting to hit its straps. 
“We can play much better than that, we are one of the best teams in the world.” 
The fact Australia powered six goals past India could also prove crucial come progression to the quarter-finals where, as it stands, the Hockeyroos look most likely to face either Germany or trans-Tasman rivals New Zealand. 
“Goal scoring is really important, if we happen to get nine points (from three wins) there could be a couple of teams on nine points, it will affect the cross-overs,’’ Commens said. 
Emily Smith’s third-quarter goal proved the difference in the Hockeyroos’ win over Argentina, it was an otherwise miserly game in which the two sides were quite evenly matched.

Australian goalkeeper Rachael Lynch’s performance was inspiring, she repelled a number of Argentina’s attacking raids with poise. Her save from a penalty corner late in the third quarter was particularly impressive. 
Australia was forced to defend with three on that corner after Bone broke early. 
Against India the day before Jodie Kenny bagged a double while Georgie Morgan, Georgie Parker, Jane Claxton and Kathryn Slattery also found the back of the net before India scored a goal of their own with just seconds remaining.

“I was a little frustrated with that last goal, but five goals is a good goal difference and it was better than Great Britain against the same opponent,” Commens said. 
“Those first three goals [were] a bit of a stress-reliever. Before we came here I said I wanted to show the Australian public the brand of hockey we can play.”​ Latest News
