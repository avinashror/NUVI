Letter: Dr. Hasan   11:30PM On July 28, a full-color ad for the “Growing Pueblo’s Future” group ran in The Pueblo Chieftain claiming to show the benefits of recreational marijuana. I request that concerned Pueblo citizens do the following: Carefully study not just the supposed benefits of recreational marijuana, but also the ballot issues that Dr. Malik Hasan has created in revenge to punish the hospitals. Please check all the facts presented by the Chieftain articles, and the editorials by the hospital leaders, showing the devastation the ballot issues would actually cause. Beware of claimed benefits in beautiful ads. Beautiful emails containing Trojan programs can demolish a computer. The Trojan Horse was beautiful, but there were only deadly results when the citizens brought it into their city. Vote No on Questions 301 and 302 — two Trojan ballot issues that would have disastrous results if they were brought into our city. Teri Darcy
