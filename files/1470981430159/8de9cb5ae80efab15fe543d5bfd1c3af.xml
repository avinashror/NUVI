Better-than-expected financial results for Kohl’s helped fuel stock gains for several other big retail chains Thursday. File/Corpus Christi Caller-Times via AP × It felt like 1999 again on Wall Street.
Strong gains by energy companies and retailers helped nudge each of the three major U.S. stock indexes to a record high close Thursday, erasing mild losses from the day before.
The S&amp;P 500 index and Nasdaq composite had previously hit new highs last Friday. The Nasdaq also notched a record close Tuesday.
It was the first time since Dec. 31, 1999, that all three indexes closed at new highs on the same day, according to the Wall Street Journal.
Investors welcomed some better-than-expected quarterly results from Macy’s and Kohl’s, which spurred gains for several other big retail chains.
Energy stocks led the rally, getting a boost from a surge in oil prices. An industry report released Thursday projected a more even balance in the supply and demand for oil this year.
“It’s been such an oversupplied market for a long period of time, to get that supply-demand closer to being in balance, or to be in balance, is a huge driver,” said David Chalupnik, head of equities for Nuveen Asset Management. “That should at least support the commodity price.”
The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 117.86 to end the session at 18,613.52. The average is now up about 0.1 percent from its last record set July 20.
The S&amp;P 500 added 10.30 to 2,185.79. The Nasdaq gained 23.81 to 5,228.40.
The latest market milestones reflect investors’ improved confidence in the U.S. economy of late. Strong job growth, more stable oil prices and a crop of better-than-expected company earnings have helped lift stocks in recent weeks.
Still, overall earnings for companies in the S&amp;P 500 are expected to be down 2.2 percent for the second quarter, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.
“We’re still looking at negative earnings growth, albeit improved, and negative revenue growth,” said Tim Dreiling, regional investment director for U.S. Bank’s Private Client Reserve. “In order for stocks to continue to make new highs and continue to grind higher, we’re going to need to see some improvement in revenues and see some improvement in earnings in the second half of 2016.”
The major stock indexes got off to a strong start early Thursday, bouncing back from slight losses a day earlier.
Traders bid up oil prices in response to the International Energy Agency’s latest forecast. The agency said it expects that supply and demand for oil will be more in balance the rest of this year. It also projected that global oil demand won’t grow as much as it previously expected next year, citing a weaker global economy.
Benchmark U.S. crude rose $1.78, or 4.3 percent, to close at $43.49 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, gained $1.99, or 4.3 percent, to close at $46.04 in London.
