Americans Keys, Johnson advance, could earn medals Americans Keys, Johnson advance, could earn medals NBC Olympics.com Published: Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) 
After all the Williams sisters drama – Venus losing in the first round of singles, Venus and Serena crashing in the first round of doubles, then Serena bowing out in her third round singles match – it’s surprising to see that the United States could still earn medals in a number of tennis competitions. Madison Keys 
Madison Keys blazed through her quarterfinal match in just an hour. She took to court 1 at 10:00 AM ET and established a 5-0 lead against Russian opponent Daria Kasatkina within 20 minutes. Though she played a bit sloppily, allowing Kasatkina to win three games, Keys ultimately took the set 6-3. 
From there, the women’s singles seventh seed blasted off in the second set, barely allowing any points. Keys won 6-3, 6-1. 
Keys will move onto the semifinals. She will play the winner of Thursday’s Johanna Konta/Angelique Kerber match, which will take place around 2 PM ET on Centre Court. Steve Johnson 
Twelfth-seeded Steve Johnson , a 26-year-old underdog at these Games, has performed exceptionally well in both singles and doubles. He easily won his third round singles match against Russia’s unseeded Evgeny Donskoy on Thursday, 6-1, 6-1. 
Johnson is also playing doubles alongside countryman Jack Sock , who lost in the first round of singles. The duo will play their semifinal doubles match at approximately 2 PM ET on court 4, but even if they lose, will compete in a Bronze Medal Match on an unspecified day/time.
