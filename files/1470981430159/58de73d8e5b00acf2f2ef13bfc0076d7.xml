New Zealand dollar jumps after rate cut 11 August 2016 Close share panel × Image copyright Getty Images The New Zealand dollar hit its highest level in more than a year after the country&apos;s central bank cut interest rates by less than expected. 
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand cut its benchmark rate to a record low of 2% from 2.25% to head off deflation risks. 
But the Kiwi dollar rose as high as $0.7351 at one point, its highest since May 2015 as some traders had expected a bigger cut. 
New Zealand&apos;s NZX 50 index edged up 0.1% to 7,353.83. Image copyright Getty Images 
Most Asian markets traded lower following falls in New York overnight. 
In Australia, the ASX 200 finished 0.6% lower at 5,508.01. 
In China, the Shanghai Composite fell 0.5% to 3,002.64, but Hong Kong&apos;s Hang Seng index rose 0.4% to close at an eight-month high of 22,580.55. 
South Korea&apos;s Kospi index edged up 0.2% to 2,048.80. 
Stock markets in Japan were closed for a public holiday. Share this story About sharing More on this story
