Broadway Ave Westpac one of 19 branches the bank is proposing to close KIRSTY LAWRENCE Last updated 17:21, August 12 2016 
More than 70 jobs could be lost if a Westpac proposal to close 19 branches goes ahead, with a Palmerston North branch among those on the chopping block. 
A meeting to discuss the fate of the Broadway Ave branch in Palmerston North was held on Wednesday, where staff were informed of the proposal for the first time. 
First Union organiser Dion Martin had been at the meeting with staff when the consultation process was announced and said they were &quot;gutted&quot;. 
&quot;All the roles are being disestablished, so they are really quite angry at the company for that.&quot; 
Martin said with two other Westpac branches in Palmerston North, they hoped there would be redeployment opportunities. 
However, in a consultation pack given to the Broadway Ave branch and obtained by Stuff , it showed only two part-time roles would be available for redeployment. 
The pack stated that over recent years the bank had seen a decline in over-the-counter transactions at the Broadway Ave branch. 
The proposed changes include closing the Broadway Ave branch and disestablishing five fulltime roles and four part-time roles. 
There would be two part-time customer service roles available for redeployment at The Plaza branch. 
The building would stay, retaining the 24/7 lobby with ATM. Ad Feedback 
Westpac would review and consider feedback until September 9, employees would be advised of the outcome on September 14 and any redeployment process would start on September 15. 
First Union spokeswoman Tali Williams said the proposal would result in 72 jobs being made redundant and 20 job transfers to other branches. 
Most of these changes were being made in rural communities and Williams said they did not understand the need for job losses in Palmerston North. 
&quot;We will definitely be pushing for redeployment to other branches – there&apos;s no reason for job losses, particularly with that one.&quot; 
She said workers around the country had been really upset by the news. 
&quot;The people we&apos;ve spoken to are really upset, really gutted and unsure about their future. 
&quot;A lot of people have been in them for even decades, so it&apos;s a very scary situation for them to be in, wondering what will happen next.&quot; 
Williams said Westpac had been saying the process was just consultation. 
A Westpac spokeswoman said customers were changing the way they banked. 
She said 85 per cent of service transactions took place outside of a branch, and online transactions had increased in the past five years by 61 per cent and log-ins via mobile devices by 33 per cent. 
&quot;Staff and customers will be the first to know [the] decision and there will be no further public comment until then.&quot; - Stuff
