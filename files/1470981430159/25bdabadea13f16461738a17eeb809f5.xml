3 cats die after condo fire on Riverton Road in Winsted Posted: Firefighters recover after a house fire in Winsted. (WFSB) WINSTED, CT (WFSB) - 
Three cats died after a condominium fire in Winsted on Thursday evening. 
The fire was reported at Riverwalk Condominiums, which is located at 111 Riverton Rd. around 7:30 p.m. 
Residents were cooking outside on a gas grill on their upper deck, when the fire got out of control and spread to the residence. The fire department was called to the scene and knocked it down in 15 minutes. 
There were no reported injuries, but three cats did die in the fire. 
&quot;Luckily, they noticed it it didn&apos;t keep it from getting into the house at least,&quot; Winsted Deputy Fire Chief Curt Mongeau said. &quot;No one was hurt and we are very happy for that.&quot; 
No other residence was impacted by the fire. Officials said the home is not a total loss. 
The weather and the especially the heat was a factor. 
&quot;It was difficult in the beginning for the first crews very warm. We had water hydrated we cycled crews in and out regularly,&quot; Mongeau said. &quot;We got mutual aid here from New Hartford, Pleasant Valley, Winchester was here and Norfolk was standing by at the station. So we had enough crews here to cycle people in and out.&quot; 
Riverton Road was closed near Riverwalk Drive during their investigation. 
The cause of the fire is under investigation.
