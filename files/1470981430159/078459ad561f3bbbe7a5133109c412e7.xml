Leaked Email: George Soros Asks Hillary Clinton to Intervene in Albania&apos;s Affairs Chris Menahan From The American Mirror : More leaked e-mails from Hillary Clintons time as Secretary of State prove that she was taking foreign policy advice from left-wing billionaire activist George Soros. An e-mail provided by WikiLeaks showed Soros reaching out to Secretary Clinton over a foreign policy dispute in Albania. [...]The left wing billionaire ... gave Clinton a list of potential nominees to appoint as mediator: Carl Bildt, Martti Ahtisaari and Miroslav Lajcak. [...]Just three days after Clinton received the e-mail from Soros the EU ended up sending Soros suggested nominee Lajcak to mediate the civil unrest, the BBC reported . Thomas Lifson commented in The American Thinker : Let us be clear here: Soros got the U.S. and other accomplices to intervene in the internal affairs of a sovereign state. Soros has long been accused of being a puppet master orchestrating world politics and markets for his own benefit. I am not certain if this is the first documented instance of his ordering an action and it being implemented by major powers, but even if there is precedent, how is this not huge news? George Soros is Hillary Clinton&apos;s second largest donor.
