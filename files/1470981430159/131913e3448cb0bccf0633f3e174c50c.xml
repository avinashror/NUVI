Simone Manuel became the first African American woman to earn a medal in an individual event in swimming – and it’s gold. She tied Canadian teenager Penny Oleksiak in an Olympic record time of 52.70 seconds in the 100m freestyle. 
Manuel and Oleksiak both made their Olympic debuts in Rio. More notably, they beat out heavy favorites, sisters Cate and Bronte Campbell. 

Sweden’s Sarah Sjostrom, who earlier this week earned gold in the 100m butterfly, took the bronze in 52.99. 
Manuel’s teammate Abbey Weitzeil finished seventh in 53.30. Manuel and Weitzeil both earned silver medals as part of the 4x100m freestyle on Sunday. Share this:
