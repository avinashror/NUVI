Soak This: PARTYNEXTDOOR – P3 (Album) Music August 12, 2016 
After two years, PARTYNEXTDOOR is back with his first effort since the 2014 EP, PNDColours . Since generating buzz for his “Come and See Me” single with the help of Kylie Jenner’s snapchat account, as well as an assist from Drake in the midst of his VIEWS LP , listeners finally receive PND3 . 
The new project, which features internal production 40, Illangelo, Nineteen85 and Supa Dups, has no other features outside of the previously mentioned 6-God cameo. Before fall arrives, take a listen below and enjoy your latest dosage of summer sounds from the self-proclaimed OMO member.
