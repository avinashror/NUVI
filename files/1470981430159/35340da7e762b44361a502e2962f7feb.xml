Aficionados of the lovely, old-school style of animation on display in the Academy Award-nominated 2010 feature &quot;A Cat in Paris&quot; will be pleased to discover a new hand-drawn tale of adventure from the French filmmakers Jean-Loup Felicioli and Alain Gagnol. Set in a mythical version of New York City — midway between the colorful Gotham of comic books and the rotten Big Apple of film noir — &quot;Phantom Boy&quot; tells the story of a sick child named Leo. During a long hospital convalescence, the 11-year-old finds that he is able to experience something like astral projection, traveling outside of his body in spirit form and zooming around the city, where he stumbles upon a plot by a criminal hacker to extort money from the city. Teaming with a similarly convalescing detective and an intrepid female journalist who still believes in shoe-leather reporting, Leo uses his strange ability to coordinate the trio&apos;s unraveling of the crime. There&apos;s an appealing quaintness to the storytelling that calls to mind the Tintin books of the artist and writer Hergé, especially that series&apos;s old-world charm. Felicioli and Gagnol&apos;s New York is a city lost in time and place, a metropolis of the imagination more than a physical location. The visuals, which are particularly effective at rendering Leo&apos;s ability to pass through solid walls, underscore the old-fashioned quality. Despite the cyberwarfare theme, &quot;Phantom Boy&quot; feels as if it could have been written 75 years ago. *** &quot;Phantom Boy&quot; Voices: Jared Padalecki, Fred Armisen, Vincent D&apos;Onofrio Rating: PG for some violence and mature thematic material, including a gravely ill child Running time: 1:24
