Harrogate Railway progressed to the preliminary round of the FA Cup after beating Albion Sports 3-0 in Wednesday night&apos;s replay at Throstle Nest. 
Steve Bromley scored twice for the visitors before fellow forward Chris Ovington capped the win late on. 
Railway will now face Norton and Stockton Ancients at home in the preliminary round on August 20. 
The two teams met in pre-season where goals from Chris Ovington and Dan Barrett gave Railway a 2-1 victory. 
Sports and Railway had shared a 1-1 draw in the initial FA Cup clash at Station View on Saturday. 
Jake Lofthouse saved a penalty to keep Railway in the cup on that occasion and he thwarted Sports again with a couple of high class saves in the first half at Throstle Nest.

The score remained goalless at the break but it only took three minutes of the second half for Bromley to put Railway ahead as he headed home Ryan Sharrocks&apos; cross. 
Bromley doubled the lead on 68 minutes when he lashed home a cross from Harry Brown. 
Ovington then put the game beyond NCEL counterparts Sports in the 81st minute by finished off a quick counter attack. 
The victory was Railway&apos;s first on the road since beating New Mills 3-0 in February and will come as a welcome relief for under pressure boss Lee Ashforth. Sign in
