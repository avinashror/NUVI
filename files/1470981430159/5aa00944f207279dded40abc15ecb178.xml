Boboye Oyeyemi, MFR, mni, FCILT, FCIPM. Corps Marshal and Chief Executive at Federal Road Safety Corps, during an assessment tour of the ongoing construction on the expressway on Thursday asked contractors to close the U-turns on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. He said that religious organisations who have properties along the expressway should submit their programmes from now till December to enable the contractors plan ways to ease vehicular movements and avoid unnecessary traffic congestion. Oyeyemi said traffic jams on the expressway was due to the impatience of drivers who unlawfully drive against traffic. He asked the construction companies working on the road to reduce the U-turns on the expressway to just two. He said: 
“Drivers need to re-plan their journeys. If you have been spending one hour, you should plan for an extra-hour. That is why we have directed that they should reduce the U-turns to two. From Lagos to Sagamu, the U-turns should not be more than two so that people will not be driving against the traffic. From Sagamu to Ibadan, the construction is going on well, so I don’t think we have any problem with that.”
