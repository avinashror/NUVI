Joggers on high alert following the deaths of two young women Pepper spray might not be enough if you can&apos;t hear your surroundings August 11, 2016, 6:12 pm Updated: Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) 
SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (WWLP) – Two joggers were murdered in the middle of the day in recent weeks, their bodies found just five days, and 200-miles apart from each other. 
The deaths of Vanessa Marcotte and Karina Vetrano occurred in separate states, but their stories are eerily similar. Marcotte’s body was found in the woods in Princeton, Massachusetts, while Vetrano’s body was found in New York near a running path. 
Their murders now has many runners in western Massachusetts taking extra precautions to stay safe. Elizabeth Hartman of Springfield told 22News she avoids walking alone whenever she can. “I usually walk with my husband, and if I walk alone, I’m very aware of the surroundings. It’s scary out there lately,” she said. 
Safety in numbers doesn’t necessarily mean you need another person. Jeanne Desrosiers uses her Germain Shepard as protection. “There are certain people that I talk to regularly around here, and he’s used to them, but other than that, strangers can’t approach me, he’s very protective,” she said. 
There are also certain items you can carry with you to help you stay if you’re on a jog. For example, you can legally purchase pepper spray in Massachusetts if you’re at least 18-years-old, a weapon you can then use to fight back if you’re under attack. 
Pepper spray might not be enough if you can’t hear your surroundings, which is why safety experts recommend avoiding headphones, running in well-lit areas, and staying vigilant at all times. Share this:
