Trash cleared from Loon Pond area Springfield hopes to get federal money for further cleanup efforts Sy Becker Published: August 11, 2016, 6:02 pm Updated: Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) 
SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (WWLP) – Indian Orchard residents have renewed hope of once again swimming in their beloved Loon Pond. The beach has been closed for years because of bacteria detected in the water. There’s also the problem of all the garbage and trash people have left along the shore line. 
Springfield parks and recreation director Patrick Sullivan told 22News that he’s applied for federal money. And even if the money doesn’t come through, he’s promised to find some way to clean up Loon Pond. 
Neighbors are hopeful. Norman Major said “I’d be happy. It would be a perfect deal for us out here in Indian Orchard.” And fellow neighborhood resident Carl Jones explained that “We always want to go swimming, but we don’t want to swim there because it’s so dirty.” 
22News ran video of the debris near the Loon Pond dock Earlier this week. When we returned on Thursday, we found park department employees had thoroughly cleaned the area. Share this:
