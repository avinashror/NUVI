Liberty Bank Surpise Squad helps a family prepare for back-to-sc - WFSB 3 Connecticut Member Center: Liberty Bank Surpise Squad helps a family prepare for back-to-school season Posted: Sarah Ayotte and her daughters. (WFSB photo) BRISTOL, CT (WFSB) - 
Back-to-school season is here. 
The Liberty Bank and Channel 3 Surprise Squad is looking to help some folks who are trying to get a head start. 
Its first mission was in Bristol this week. 
Parents know that back-to-school shopping can be a stressful time, especially when it comes to the bill. 
That&apos;s why the squad headed to Staples. It sought to foot the bill instead. 
The mission, however, changed slightly after the squad received a nomination about one of Melinda Santana&apos;s coworkers, Sarah Ayotte. 
&quot;She has picked up a summer job to try to make her back to school shopping for her kids,&quot; Santana said. 
Ayotte is a mother of three who has only been working at Staples for five days. 
The squad couldn&apos;t wait to do something special for her and her daughters, who are in 7th, 5th and 3rd grades. 
While Ayotte was busy working in the back of the store, the squad packed a shopping cart full of school supplies and backpacks. 
After the spree was complete, everything was wheeled to the front of the store. 
The plan was to call Ayotte to the front register afterward, but she arrived early in the middle of an interview. 
So the squad just rolled with it. 
Ayotte saw the big purchase and asked if the squad wanted to use its rewards card. 
That&apos;s when the surprise was revealed. 
&quot;How did I get so lucky?&quot; she asked. 
The squad gave her one more gift as well. It was a gift card just in case anything was left out of the cart. 
All that was left was to take the supplies home to her girls. 
&quot;I think they&apos;re going to be blown away,&quot; Ayotte said. &quot;I&apos;m going to come home with all this stuff, and they&apos;re going to say, &apos;Ma!&apos;&quot; 
Ayotte said before the squad&apos;s visit, she hadn&apos;t started her girls&apos; school shopping.
