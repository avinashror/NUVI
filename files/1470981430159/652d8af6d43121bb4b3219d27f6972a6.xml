Windfall fuels more spending, steady tax rates in Pasco budget plan 4 Weeks Ago 
Values are expected to grow by 4.87 percent, which will bring in nearly $700,000 in extra revenue if the city keeps the property tax rate at $5.45 per $1,000 of taxable, assessed property value, meaning the owner of a home valued at $150,000 with a homestead exemption of $50,000 would pay $545 in city taxes. 
The commission locked in that rate at a July budget workshop, preventing it from being raised at upcoming public hearings in September. But Mayor Chris Alahouzos says he plans to vote to lower the rate to either $5.42 or $5.39 at the first hearing. 
&quot;I think it would be a huge step in the right direction because it would make Tarpon Springs more desirable to businesses, which will eventually increase revenue coming into the city,&quot; he said. &quot;I believe a lower rate is something we can handle as a city, and I believe it is the right thing to do.&quot; 
City Manager Mark LeCouris said the proposed budget shows the city is in a healthy financial state after suffering through several years of a struggling economy. 
&quot;The best thing about this budget is that for the first time in many years we won&apos;t have to pull from the reserves,&quot; he said, adding that because of the property value increase, the city will not have to sacrifice much-needed projects or its savings. 
The proposed $55 million budget for fiscal year 2016-17 shows a series of water and sewer projects, totaling nearly $6 million combined. The biggest chunk of money — about $1.4 million — will go toward providing sewer lines to residents near Lake Tarpon and on Seabreeze Drive who are still using septic tanks. About $785,000 will be spent to extend reclaimed water to the Westwinds subdivision off Westwinds Boulevard. Other projects include solar panel installation at the city water plant, water pipe replacements, sewer line improvements, new equipment for sewage treatment and other miscellaneous upgrades and repairs. 
The budget also includes a series of proposed stormwater projects, totaling about $385,000, that will alleviate severe flooding throughout the city. Areas to be improved include: Jasmine Avenue and Lime Street, Marina Drive and Anclote Road, Alt. U.S. 19 and Anclote Road, Riverside Drive and Hillside Drive, Highland Avenue and Vista Place, Bath Street and Shaddock Avenue Alley, Disston Avenue south of Harrison Street. 
The city plans to also improve sidewalks and roadways, including Meres Boulevard, Spruce Street. Others will be decided later based on need, LeCouris said. The city has also budgeted $300,000 — matching the amount officials asked the county for — toward the project to dredge the Anclote River. 
About $1.4 million is budgeted for culture and recreation projects. About $700,000 will go toward the swimming pool being built at Tarpon Springs High School, and the rest will pay for new field lights at Dorsett Park and Riverside Field, improvements to the Community Center, improvements to Craig Park and renovations at the city library. 
The Police Department and fire rescue will get new vehicles, totaling about $350,000 coming from the Penny for Pinellas fund. 
LeCouris said the new budget will allow the city to do &quot;a lot more a lot sooner&quot; than officials and staff thought possible. 
&quot;We hoped we would get to this point by next year,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s nice being a year ahead of schedule.&quot;
