Jennifer Lopez Gushes Over Her 8-Year-Old Twins in Adorable New Photo So cute! 
It&apos;s no secret that Jennifer Lopez values every single moment she gets with her 8-year-old twins, and her latest post on social media proves that once again. The proud mama took to Instagram today to gush over her adorable kids Max and Emme, and her sweet words seriously made our hearts melt. In the &apos;gram, Lopez and her two lookalikes ride in a car together as she snaps a photo of the trio. Her son sits on her lap, while her daughter rests in the seat next to them. Can you believe how big they&apos;re getting? 
RELATED: Jennifer Lopez Wears Sexiest, Sparkliest, Most Naked Dress Ever And while the photo itself is adorable, the message that she wrote alongside the snap is even more touching. &quot;This pic is a lil washed out but I feel the camera captured the feeling of the moment,&quot; she said. &quot;I always feel love, light and like Im in a dream when Im with these two... #familia #LOVE #truelove.&quot; Aug 11, 2016 at 2:54pm PDT We can&apos;t handle all the cuteness.
