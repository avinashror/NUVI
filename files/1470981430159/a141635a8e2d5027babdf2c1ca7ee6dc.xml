Karma is showing off its first model, Revero (Photo: Karma)
LOS ANGELES -- The look will be instantly familiar, but some of the technology will be new.
It&apos;s the unveiling of the Revero, the first car from Karma, which picked up the pieces from the failure of Fisker Automotive, the startup that rose right about the time that Tesla Motors was getting the start.
Fisker Automotive was the brainchild of car designer Henrik Fisker, who came up with a sexy, high-style plug-in hybrid that stood in contrast to the all-electrics that were produced by Tesla. On paper, at least, it should have been a better idea: Though not as ecological, a car took the range-anxiety worry out of owning a plug-in. Plus, his designs were undeniably beautiful.
Karma, which plans to produce at a factory east of Los Angeles, starts with a car that picks up where the old Fiskers left off. The new one looks identical, but the company says it adds a lot of new features, including a solar roof that actually helps to power the car. (Others have tried solar panels on roofs, but the power usually went to air conditioning or other systems, not the wheels).
Karma plans to sell its car through eight dealers initially, and its own &quot;experience center&quot; in Orange County, Calif.
