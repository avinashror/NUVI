Holyoke Soldiers Home honors their purple heart recipients The Purple Heart is awarded to military members wounded in combat Logan Leavitt Published: August 11, 2016, 11:02 pm Updated: Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) 
HOLYOKE, Mass. (WWLP) – The Holyoke Soldiers Home held a special ceremony of recognition Thursday to honor their Purple Heart recipients. 
The Holyoke Veterans Society organized this dedication to wounded combat veterans. Friends and family of the recipients gathered for the presentation of the Purple Heart Flag. 
The Purple Heart is one of the oldest American military medals, awarded to military members wounded in combat. 
Bennett Walsh, Superintendent of the Holyoke Soldiers Home, told 22News, “It was really an honor, as I told the veterans here and their families, to be able to speak to them and thank them for their service, because the Purple Heart is a medal you don’t want to receive.” 
The Soldiers Home in Holyoke is a state-funded health care facility that provides health care to our veterans. There are Purple Heart recipients living in the Soldiers Home ranging from World War II to the Vietnam War. Share this:
