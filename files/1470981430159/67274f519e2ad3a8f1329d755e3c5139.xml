Back to School: Teacher&apos;s Advice Share This Story CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST Back to school advice from teachers. Bob Roudybush, Amanda Coulter, Mansa Joseph 
Columbia, SC (WLTX) “You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose.” (Dr. Seuss, Oh The Places You’ll Go – BOOK) Wisdom by Dr. Seuss…and the lesson that teachers try to impart – above all – to our kids…yours and mine…every day. Darci Strickland interviews her 4th grade teacher Mrs. Henerietta Reese 
As a mom of three, I’m here to tell you – that’s a daunting task on the best of days. This is one of the countless reasons why we’re so appreciative of the amazing women and men who teach our babies. Back to School talking with teachers Kevin Herbert, Casey Faulkenberry 
Not only do kids learn to read and write in these classrooms...they learn character, they learn how to treat each other, they learn how to be successful in a world that’s not always easy. Interviews with teachers Raushanna Warren, Tanya Mabry. 
Now, the beginning of the school year is upon us. And we want it to be the best year EVER for all our kids! So we went to the experts – incredible teachers, Yodas of schools from Columbia to Orangeburg and almost everywhere in between – to ask them for their teacher secrets. What does it take for a kid to make it? How does one become a star student? Teacher of the year Jennifer Wise and Shelia Beaver 
And the best question of all – What advice would you give to yourself if you were a kid heading into the grade you teach now? Back to School Teachers Guide Jim Gandy and Daniel Bonds 
“Mrs. Reece it’s great to be in my 4th grade classroom”, says Darci Strickland. “Darci it’s wonderful to see you. I can’t tell you I ‘m just thrilled we could get together, “says Darci’s teacher Heneritta Reece as they gathered in their old classroom at Northside Christian Academy in North Charleston. “How does it feel to be back in the classroom for you?” “Well, I think the big thing when I walked t the door and you were coming down the hallway I was flooded with memories, those sweet memories of teaching her and of sweet little girls like you coming to my classroom,” says Reese. Back to school Tracy Scoville 
Listen to your teachers, kids! Somehow, they really do seem to know everything. And remember, “The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more you learn, the more places you’ll go!”
