Nip Tuk Sark&apos;s Carl Hester will continue his quest for an Olympic medal later.
The dressage star got his campaign under way in Rio yesterday and recorded a solid opening score of 75%.
The 49-year-old had to call on all his years of experience after his horse, Nip Tuck, appeared to spook and collided with the perimeter fence.
The team medals, which Hester and Great Britain won gold in last time in London 2012, will be decided today.
