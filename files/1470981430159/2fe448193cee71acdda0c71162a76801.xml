Beam me to Beantown: Capt. Kirk headlining Boston Comic Con - MSNewsNow.com - Jackson, MS Member Center: Beam me to Beantown: Capt. Kirk headlining Boston Comic Con 
BOSTON (AP) - Capt. James Tiberius Kirk is beaming down to Beantown for this weekend&apos;s Comic Con. 
The Boston edition of the popular entertainment and comic arts festival gets underway Friday and runs through Sunday at the Seaport World Trade Center. 
This year&apos;s celebrity guests include &quot;Star Trek&apos;s&quot; William Shatner, best known for his role as Capt. Kirk of the Starship Enterprise, and Gillian Anderson of &quot;The X-Files.&quot; 
Costumed role players brandishing light sabers and engaging in what&apos;s become known as &quot;cosplay&quot; got an early start by visiting young patients to cheer them up Thursday at Spaulding Rehabilitation Center&apos;s Pediatric Unit. 
Organizers say the three-day gathering is expected to draw 45,000 people, many dressed as Batman, Hello Kitty, Sailor Moon and a host of other characters.
