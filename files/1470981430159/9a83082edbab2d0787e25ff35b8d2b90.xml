SANDY — Defender Chris Schuler is back with Real Salt Lake after the team re-signed him Thursday after he spent time with the Real Monarchs. 
Schuler, who’s played in 80 matches over six seasons with RSL , signed with the Monarchs March 18. He played in nine matches for the Monarchs, the RSL affiliate in the USL. 
&quot;We’ve kept a close eye on him throughout the year and we are satisfied that he is healthy and ready to contribute to the first team,” RSL general manager Craig Waibel said in a team press release. “A veteran presence like his is valuable on the field and in the locker room and he will be a good addition to our group.” 
Schuler had his 2015 season limited by a variety of injuries, and he went to the Monarchs after rehabbing a foot injury. 
“It’s been a crazy 18 months. I had a knee surgery, a foot surgery, was unemployed, signed with the Monarchs and yesterday finally earned another RSL contract,&quot; Schuler said in a team press release. &quot;None of this would have been possible without the support of my family, friends, teammates and the entire Real Salt Lake organization.” Recommended Stories
