Explosive school growth brings teachers to Frisco Explosive growth in Frisco ISD Jobin Panicker, WFAA 11:42 PM. CDT August 11, 2016 Kristen Davis CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST 
FRISCO -- Kristen Davis&apos; life is starting to come full circle. 
After going to school in Frisco, she is now hired to be a teacher in one of the country&apos;s fastest-growing school districts. 
&quot;It&apos;s more than I could dream,&quot; she said. 
Now she has a classroom with her name on it at Fowler Middle School which is located in Plano, but is in Frisco ISD. The language teacher will also coach volleyball and soccer, and is excited for the year to start. 
She is one of 600 new teachers to Frisco ISD. Joining her at Fowler Middle is Matt Hedrick, who will teach band. 
Matt came with two years of teaching experience in Richardson before making the move to Frisco. Both teachers are embarking on a journey that has been afforded to hundreds in Frisco lately.

&quot;That&apos;s something that I wanted to be a part of,&quot; Matt said. 
There&apos;s no better way to express the growth of the Collin County city than to show the numbers. 
Frisco ISD is growing at a rate of 3,500 new students a year. In 1993, there were roughly 1,900 students in the district. In 2016, it&apos;s pushing close to 54,000 students. No district in the country grew faster. 
Frisco ISD is set to open four new campuses for the 2016-2017 calendar year. 
&quot;I&apos;ve been in Frisco for 15 years, and I&apos;ve been through a lot of the growth that we have seen,&quot; said Principal Donnie Wiseman at Fowler Middle.

Wiseman says he&apos;ll add five new teachers to his campus. 
&quot;There&apos;s lots of transition involved with this,&quot; he said. 
And the district is not done building. Miles up the road from Fowler Middle is Lawler Middle, which is under construction and should open in 2017 to relieve other schools in the area. 
Growing schools is one reason Matt chose Frisco. 
&quot;The band program here is almost 400 kids, which is a big program,&quot; he said. 
Late in August, Frisco ISD voters will decide whether the district can raise its Maintenance and Operations (M&amp;O) tax rate 13 cents. It comes out to $443 more a year on home valued at roughly $365,000, which is the average cost of a home in Frisco. 
Teachers at Frisco ISD start district professional development this week and will have a full week at their campuses, starting Monday. School starts soon after, on Aug. 22.
