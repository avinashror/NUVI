CHICOPEE, Mass. (Mass Appeal) Humans are verbal. We primarily communicate and learn through speaking with one another. Dogs are visual. They primarily communicate and learn through body language and observing. Jill Haley Rose, Certified Professional Dog Trainer from Paws of Nature Family Dog Training taught us how to communicate with our four legged friends. 
We can be very confusing to our dogs. We talk non-stop and assume they can somehow understand everything we are saying. 
Because of this, miscommunication between species frequently occurs which can make training a challenge and lead to behavior issues. 
In order to better communicate with our canine friends, we need to follow some easy guidelines. 
1) Establish a Reward Marker 
A signal or a special word that always means Yes! followed by a good reward. This is different than praise. All family members should use this same word. Ex. of reward marker = Dog sits, owner says “YES!” and gives dog a tasty treat. Ex. of praise = Dog sits, owner says, “awww good girl!” 
2) Consequences must be immediate 
A reward must happen while the dog is performing the behavior or immediately upon completion. Ex. Dog sits. Dog stands back up and scratches his ear. Owner rewards dog. Owner has just communicated that standing up and scratching was what he liked. 
3) Be sure you are naming what you want. 
Avoid chanting a word over and over at the dog while he is doing something else. He needs to know how to do it first before you start attaching human language to the behavior. Dogs need 50 or more perfect pairings of a verbal word to the right behavior before they may start putting them together. Ex. Coming when called.
