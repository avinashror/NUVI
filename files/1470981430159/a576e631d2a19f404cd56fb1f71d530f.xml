Michael Phelps becomes first swimmer to earn four golds in a row, wins 200m IM Phelps earns fourth straight Olympic gold in 200m IM NBC Olympics.com Published: August 11, 2016, 10:32 pm Updated: Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) 
Michael Phelps became the first swimmer ever to win four consecutive golds in the same event by winning his fourth consecutive 200m individual medley Olympic title on Thursday night. He stopped the clock at one minute, 54.66 seconds, off Ryan Lochte’s world record of 1:54.00. 
Phelps earned his 15th individual Olympic gold, breaking his tie with Soviet gymnast Larisa Latynina for the record. His gold also marks the first time a swimmer earned at least three gold medals in four different Olympic Games. 
Japan’s Kosuke Hagino won the silver medal behind Phelps in a time of 1:56.61 also won the gold in the 400m IM earlier in the week. 
China’s Wang Shun took the bronze in a time of 1:57.61. 
Lochte, a three-time Olympic medalist in this event, finished fifth with his time of 1:57.47. Phelps will race in the semifinal of the 100m butterfly about 30 minutes after exiting the pool from the 200m IM. Share this:
