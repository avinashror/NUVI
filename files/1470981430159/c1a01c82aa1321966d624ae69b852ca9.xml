Carly Rae Jepsen’s ‘Super Natural’ with Danny L Harle Is Here At Last, Still Perfect by Bradley Stern August 12, 2016 12:34 AM Instagram: @carlyraejepsen 
After weeks of teasing , leaks and live performances , Carly Rae Jepsen ‘s long-awaited collaboration with PC Music’s Danny L Harle finally sees the (official) light of day today (August 12) — and it is, of course, well worth the wait. 
After singlehandedly saving pop last year with her masterpiece E·MO·TION , the Queen of Being Queen of Things returns in 2016 with “Super Natural,” a glorious, glitchy techno-pop bop to tide us over before her Next Coming — which is reportedly getting “disco-y.” (Album of the year, already.) 
“ This isn’t normal, not at all / It’s just like we don’t try / We just fit, you and I / We are super natural, ” she breathily swoons on the blippy chorus, providing her signature, heart eyes emoji us-against-the-world optimism, a la “Run Away With Me.” 
The collaboration’s a major win for Carly’s cool cred given the PC Music collective co-sign, and an equally beneficial opportunity for the “Broken Flowers” producer and under-the-radar record label to gain some mainstream visibility. 
But most of all, it is a win for us , the loyal disciples of Carly Rae Jepselegend. 
“ You gotta believe in me… ” 
Oh, we do, Carly. We do.
