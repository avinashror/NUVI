Qatar (1-1-1) rescue late 25-25 draw vs. Tunisia (0-1-2) 
10:05 a.m. 
Qatar avoided the upset against Tunisia today, rescuing a late draw in the final moments of play on Thursday morning. 
Issam Tej, who was red carded early in Tunisia’s second round match, bounced back this time around, scoring four goals. 
Qatar had an opportunity to fight back in the game with a power play in the 17th minute of the second half, but poor defense gave an undermanned Tunisia team space to work the ball into the net. Another opportunity came in the 23rd minute to level it at 22 all, but a costly turnover gave Tunisia the fast break to open the lead to two instead. 
Tunisia’s chances of an upset seemed to fade away in the final moments of play, as they missed chances to put away the match. 
Two goals in the final minute were enough for Qatar, with Kamal Aldin Mallash leveling the game in the final 12 seconds of play from a shot in the bottom right. Rafael Capote scored 12 goals for the Qatari side. Share this:
