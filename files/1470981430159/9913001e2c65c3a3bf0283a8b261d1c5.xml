MINNEAPOLIS - A northeast Minneapolis man is charged with murder after police say he shot his neighbor during a feud over a broken lawnmower. 
Edward Frank Holzinger faces a 40-year sentence if he is convicted of second degree murder. 
A criminal complaint details how officers were dispatched to a home on the 100 block of 15th Avenue Northeast shortly after 8:30 p.m. Tuesday. On arrival several people directed them to the body of 47-year-old Bruce Wayne Brown, who was laying on the sidewalk. Brown&apos;s niece was kneeling beside him trying to stop profuse bleeding from his chest. Paramedics soon arrived on the scene but were unable to revive Brown, who was pronounced dead on the scene. 
When police asked who was responsible, a witness pointed to the stop of the steps, where the 61-year-old Holzinger was standing. The defendant put his hands in the air and cooperated with officers who placed him under arrest. A search of Holzinger&apos;s home turned up a 9mm handgun with a discharged bullet casing in the gun&apos;s slide. 
Witnesses who knew the men told investigators that they were involved in a dispute over Holzinger&apos;s lawnmower that had escalated over a few day&apos;s time. A woman who rented a room in Holzinger&apos;s home said earlier that evening she had seen the defendant sitting on his porch with a handgun. When she asked him what he was doing, he reportedly said &quot;waiting for that son of a b**** Bruce, and if Bruce came over he was going to shoot him.&quot; She went in to take a nap, but woke to the sound of gunfire. When she ran outside, she saw Holzinger standing over Brown&apos;s body. She told police that when she asked what happened, the defendant said &quot;I&apos;m going to jail.&quot; 
Brown&apos;s niece told police that she and other family members were grilling out in Brown&apos;s back yard when he shouted to Holzinger, sarcastically asking him if he wanted to come over for a hamburger. Holzinger reportedly shouted for Brown to &quot;come over and find out.&quot; Family members tried to calm him down, but Brown barged over to Holzinger&apos;s home, and gunshots soon rang out. She says while trying to save her uncle Holzinger came out of his house and said “He deserved it; He called me a pedophile; I know I’m going to jail and I don’t care.” 
When questioned by investigators Holzinger told them that he and Brown had been in a running argument over the past week, and that Brown &quot;wouldn&apos;t leave it alone.&quot; He reportedly admitted to the shooting.
