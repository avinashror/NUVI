Day seven of shooting in Rio features the men’s 50m rifle prone competition, and the women’s skeet event. 
Qualification for 50m rifle prone starts at 8:00 a.m., and the final begins at 10:00 a.m. 
Hoping to advance to the final will be U.S. shooter Michael McPhail. He recently won gold in the discipline at the World Cup Final in 2015. He finished ninth in the event at the 2012 London Games. 
David Higgins will also represent the U.S. The 22-year-old will be competing in his first ever Olympics. 
Warren Potent of Australia will also look to contend. The 54-year-old shooter won bronze in the 2008 Beijing Games, and recently won gold in the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games. 
The women’s skeet event also starts qualifications at 8:00 a.m., but the final will start at 2:00 p.m. 
All eyes will be on USA’s Kim Rhode, and rightfully so. Rhode is the reigning skeet shooting gold medalist, and has won an individual medal in five consecutive Olympics. If she is to place in this competition, she will become the first Summer Olympian to win six-straight individual Olympic medals. 
Looking to share the spotlight with Rhode is another U.S. shooter, Morgan Craft. The 23-year-old Pennsylvania native recently won gold at the World Championships in Lonato. 
China’s Wei Ning also has a great shot at medaling. The 34-year-old has two Olympic silver medals in the discipline to her credit, one at the 2004 Athens Games and again at the 2012 London Games. 
Catch all the action on NBCOlympics.com or the NBC Sports App.
