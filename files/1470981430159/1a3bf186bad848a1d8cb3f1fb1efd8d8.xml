It was surface-of-the-sun hot in Arlington today and the Rangers and Rockies decided it was a good idea to play a game where they stand outside for over four hours today. 
The Rangers rallied, as they are wont to do, from deficits of 4-0, 6-3, and 7-5 to take a 9-7 lead heading into the top of the 8th before the Rockies did a Rangers on us and scored five runs in the inning to take a 12-9 lead that the Rangers eventually couldn&apos;t overcome. 
The Rangers won three games they maybe shouldn&apos;t have and lost a Lucas Harrell start. Meh. I&apos;m shrugging and watching handball. 
Handball gif of the day: 
Player of the Game : Basically everyone but the people who threw the baseballs. Rougned Odor tripled, homered, and drove in three runs. Mitch Moreland went 3-for-4 with a home run. Adrian Beltre tied Cal Ripken Jr. for 47th all-time in homers with his 431th dong. 
Jurickson Profar had a couple of hits and a walk. Nomar Mazara had a couple of walks and a hit. And Ian Desmond looked ready to break out of his slump as he collected two hits, scored twice, and drove in a couple. 
Up Next : The Rangers try to get another winning streak started in the opener against the Tigers . Yu Darvish will take the mound against RHP Anibal Sanchez of Detroit. First pitch is scheduled for 7:05 pm CT.  Share Share on Facebook 55 Comments ⋆ Rec Recommend this Post 2 Latest News
