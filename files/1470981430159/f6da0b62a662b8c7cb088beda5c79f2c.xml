Five storylines to watch 
Goodbye and hello: Realignment moved Atascocita, Kingwood and Summer Creek out of the district and brought in Lufkin, West Brook and Montgomery. 
Long journey: West Brook will travel good distances from Beaumont for district trips this season to play at College Park, Lufkin and Conroe. League coaches are puzzled about West Brook&apos;s placement in this district, made up primarily of Conroe ISD teams. 
Moving back up: After a two-year hiatus, Lufkin returns to the state&apos;s largest classification. The Panthers are talented enough – mainly at the skill positions – that they should be a factor in district. 
Not the biggest: Can Montgomery make a playoff push with only four total returning starters and lack of size? The Bears aren&apos;t expected to start a defender over 200 pounds. 
Versatile athletes: College Park relies on a number of multi-sport athletes, including quarterback Jordan Turnquest , a three-year varsity basketball player. 
Players to watch QB Eric Schmid , The Woodlands: The senior is displaying a much quicker release than last season, a byproduct of leading the Highlanders to the 7-on-7 state championship. 
OL Dan Moore , West Brook: Bruins running backs love running behind the 6-5, 330-pound Oklahoma State pledge, one of only three returning starters on offense. 
QB Colby Kizzie , Conroe: Beginning his third year as a starter, Kizzie passed for 1,700 yards last season. 
LB Grant Stuard , Oak Ridge: One district coach likens Stuard to former Steelers star Troy Polamalu , for the length of his hair and his ability to make plays. 
Must-see games 
The Woodlands vs. Katy, Sept. 9, Woodforest Stadium: The last time these teams played here, the Highlanders won 24-7. This is the best non-district rivalry in the Houston area. 
Conroe vs. Oak Ridge, Sept. 23, Woodforest Stadium: The winner will be looking good in a district opener between the two rivals. 
The Woodlands vs. Lufkin, Sept. 30, Woodforest Stadium: Both defenses are physical and aggressive. And both teams possess experienced and talented quarterbacks. 
The Woodlands vs. West Brook, Oct. 7, Carroll Butch Stadium: Catching the Highlanders at home will benefit the Bruins, but playing them after losing a large senior class will be challenging. 
District predictions 
1. The Woodlands; 2. Lufkin; 3. West Brook; 4. Montgomery; 5. College Park; 6. Conroe; 7. Oak Ridge.
