BOSTON (AP) — Investigators probing the killing of a New York City woman who went for a run near her mother’s home in central Massachusetts and later was found dead in the woods say she was attacked by a man and she may have injured him in a struggle. 
Worcester District Attorney Joseph Early Jr. asked for the public’s help Thursday identifying a man with scratches, scrapes or bruises sustained Sunday. 
Vanessa Marcotte , a 27-year-old Google account manager, was found dead Sunday night hours after she went for a run near her mother’s home in Princeton, a rural town west of Boston. 
Early says they believe the attack happened between 1:00 p.m. and 3:00 p.m. Sunday. Early asked people to report any cars that were on Brooks Station Road then. The anonymous tip line is 508-453-7589 . Related Vanessa Marcotte Coverage:
