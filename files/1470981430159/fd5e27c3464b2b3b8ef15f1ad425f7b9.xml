  Trumbo hits slam, majors-leading 32nd HR, leads O&apos;s over A&apos;s By Michael Wagaman/AP 7:15pm, August 11, 2016 Mark Trumbo hit a grand slam for his major league-leading 32nd homer and drove in five runs as the Baltimore Orioles beat the Oakland Athletics 9-6 Thursday to avoid a four-game sweep. The Orioles had been shut out for 17 straight innings and lost their lead in the AL East following three consecutive one-run losses before Trumbo sparked them. The All-Star slugger hit an RBI single in a three-run fourth, then connected the next inning for his third career grand slam. Chris Tillman (15-4) allowed two runs over seven innings for his first victory since July 21. He is Baltimore&apos;s first 15-game winner since Bud Norris and Wei-Yin Chen in 2014. Zach Britton retired three batters for his AL-leading 35th save this season and his 37th consecutive dating to last season. The A&apos;s loaded the bases in the ninth after a replay overturn before Britton got Danny Valencia to ground out to end it. Andrew Triggs (0-1) was the eighth different starter in eight games for the A&apos;s. Copyright © Aug 11,
