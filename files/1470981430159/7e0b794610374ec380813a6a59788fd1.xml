400-year-old shipwreck found off Florida coast WESH&apos;s Dan Billow Published: August 11, 2016, 10:05 am Updated: Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Divers with Global Marine Exploration say they have found the remains of what appear to be three french ships just a couple miles from shore. 
(WESH) Divers off the coast of Cape Canaveral, Florida discovered a 400-year-old shipwreck that they believe may have belonged to the French. 
Divers with Global Marine Exploration believe the remains are from three different French ships, and the contents include canons made of bronze and iron, anchors, and symbols of the fleur-de-lis and a French coat of arms archaeologists call priceless. 
Archaeologists say the details will be difficult to verify, but they’re likely from the French colonial period around year 1560 and they may have sunk in the midst of a hurricane. 
Working with the Florida Department of Historic Resources, the company hopes to bring up the artifacts and conserve them.
