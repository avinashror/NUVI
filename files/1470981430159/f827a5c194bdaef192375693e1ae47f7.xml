Ex-Services Tennis Club raises almost $400 for Ronald McDonald House Chrissie Kjoller 12 Aug 2016, 9 a.m. A wrap-up of Ex-Services Tennis Club&apos;s week. DONATIONS: Helen Chapman (middle) presenting money to Alison Wilkins (left) and Rebecca Walsh (right) of Ronald McDonald House. Photo:CONTRIBUTED 
MONIES raised from our Biggest Morning Tea was donated to our chosen charity, Ronald McDonald House. 
Life member and committee member Helen Chapman presented RMH’s Rebecca Walsh and Alison Wilkins with $370, raised from the morning tea and our regular ladies social tennis. 
They were most grateful and said all money raised goes a long way. Our donation alone keeps the rooms open at RMH for three nights. 
Last weekend a contingent of men travelled to Forbes to content their Teams Tournament. 
Rick Taylor, Col Parsons, Ningshong Cai, Brad Penrose, Brett Campbell, Daniel and David Kozul had some success, winning quite a few sets against strong opposition. 
On Sunday some of our juniors will play in Dubbo’s leg of the Junior Development Series (JDS). 
On Saturday there is a Central West Development Squad training session. 
Save the date in the upcoming school holidays, for our coaching clinics. 
They will be held during both weeks on September 26-28 and also October 5-7. 
We had two courts in use on Wednesday night for our winter warmers social. 
Mixed social last Sunday had a pleasing turnout with Aleks Radojicic winning the Woodward Street Quality Meat voucher. 
Brett Campbell will be the committee person on duty to run Sunday’s mixed at 1.30pm and prior to social, there will be a committee meeting commencing at 12.30pm. Latest News
