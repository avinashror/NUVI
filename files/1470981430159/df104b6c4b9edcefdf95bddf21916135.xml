DENVER BUSINESS JOURNAL - Denver-based global building products manufacturer Johns Manville is the latest company to put its name on a downtown Denver skyscraper, emblazoning the top of 717 17th St. with four-foot letters earlier this month. 
The Berkshire Hathaway company&apos;s logo can be seen on the side of the building that fronts 17th Street, the company said Wednesday. Johns Manville has since 1988 occupied 120,000 square feet in five of the building&apos;s 29 floors, employing 300 people there. Another 400 people work at the Johns Manville Technical Center in Littleton. 
&quot;JM has called Colorado home since 1972 and is proud to have our world headquarters in downtown Denver,&quot; said Mary Rhinehart, president and CEO. &quot;That&apos;s why we are excited to give Johns Manville a prominent presence in Denver&apos;s skyline. The sign represents JM&apos;s longstanding commitment to its employees, customers and community.&quot; 
Johns Manville is the latest company to install or change exterior signage on Denver&apos;s skyline of late. Law firm Holland &amp; Hart added theirs to 555 17th St. in July, TIAA updated its sign on 1670 Broadway in May to reflect the company&apos;s name change and 1801 California got new Transamerica signs in addition to CenturyLink&apos;s last fall.
