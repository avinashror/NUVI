19-year-olds Simone Biles and Katie Ledecky, both born in mid-March 1997, are both megastars at the top of their game at the Rio Olympics. They each have the chance to come back from Rio with up to five medals. 
The facts: 
Swimming sensation Katie Ledecky won a surprising 800m freestyle Olympic gold at just 15 years old at the 2012 London Games. At the subsequent world championships, she’s never lost a race. At the 2016 Olympics, she has so far claimed gold in the 200m freestyle, 400m freestyle and 4x200m freestyle, plus won a silver in the 4x100m freestyle relay. She attempts to defend her 800m freestyle title in Friday’s final. 
Simone Biles burst onto the scene in 2013 with her first all-around World title. She hasn’t lost an all-around competition since, claiming two more World all-around titles – becoming the first woman ever to win three straight – and a bevy of apparatus medals for a total of 14. She made her Olympic debut in Rio and won gold with her “Final Five” teammates on Tuesday; she’ll look to prove her dominance again in the all-around final on Thursday.
