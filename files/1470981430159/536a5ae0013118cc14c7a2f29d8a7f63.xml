HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Jerry Sandusky plans to take the stand and try to prove his claim he was wrongly convicted four years ago of sexually abusing 10 boys. 
The former Penn State assistant football coach is expected to testify in a Pennsylvania courthouse on Friday during a Post-Conviction Relief Act hearing that aims to overturn his 45-count conviction. 
The 72-year-old Sandusky didn&apos;t testify at his trial in 2012. His lawyer says he expects Sandusky&apos;s testimony to be lengthy. 
The presiding judge said in June the hearing will delve into a prosecutor&apos;s closing statement, the decision to let Sandusky give a TV interview after his arrest and other issues. 
The hearing is expected to continue on Aug. 22 and Aug. 23. 
Sandusky is serving a 30- to 60-year sentence.
