Updated: August 12, 2016 10:44 IST ‘Step up waste segregation projects’ Staff Reporter Tweet Commissioner for Municipal Administration G. Prakash (centre) inspecting waste segregation in an apartment in the city on Thursday.— Photo:S. Siva Saravanan. Commissioner for Municipal Administration (CMA) G. Prakash asked the Corporation and Non-Government Organisations involved in waste segregation at source to expand the same to all the apartments in the Corporation limits. He said this after visiting an apartment near Kidney Centre, Puliyakulam, where the apartment segregates all the wastes into degradable, non-degradable, recyclable and non-recyclable. A Corporation official said that doing so has reduced waste segregation by 20 per cent in the nearly 20 apartments where it is in practice. Representative of an NGO that has been closely working with the Corporation in the project said that they would soon be initiating a study on the number of apartments in the city and reach out to them to be part of the project. The CMA then inspected the door-to-door waste collection and segregation at Ward 90, Kovaipudur, and the vermin compost unit at Vellalore. He asked the Corporation to increase the capacity of vermin compost production and the government would fund the same. He also asked them to study possibilities of making use of water collected from the sewage treatment plant, at Ukkadam, for watering plants at the Corporation’s dump yard at Vellalore by taking the water through pipelines. He asked them to work out greenery projects using treated sewage water. Corporation Commissioner K. Vijayakarthikeyan and officials from the Corporation were also present during the inspections. Earlier that day, the CMA chaired a meeting with the Corporation officials on the ‘Smart City’ project. Mr. Prakash also honoured national award winning sanitary worker Nagaraj and launched a mobile application that could be used to study waste generation by apartments.
