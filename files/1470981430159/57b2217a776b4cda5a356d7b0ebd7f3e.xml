Homeland&apos;s Quinn Will Be a &quot;Changed Man&quot; in Season 6   12, 2016 at 12:01 AM Updated at 12:08 AM Posted Aug. 12, 2016 at 12:01 AM Updated at 12:08 AM Fans will see a very different version of Quinn ( Rupert Friend ) when Homeland returns for Season 6 in January. At the end of the show&apos;s well-received fifth season, the fan-favorite character appeared to die in the final scenes. On Thursday, during the Television Critics Association fall previews, showrunner Alex Gansa revealed that although Quinn survived , &quot;his very existence was in question, so you&apos;re going to see a very changed and altered Quinn.&quot; &quot;I think Quinn, this coming season, will really represent a profound and familiar casualty of the war on terror for our audience,&quot; he continued. &quot;What he endured last year is different from what he&apos;ll go through this year. This year will be fused with his daily relationship with Claire [Danes&apos;] character.&quot; Ganza also revealed that this season, which will be set in New York after the series spent much of last season in Germany, will focus on the continued ramifications of 9/11 on the United States. Catch up on all the latest news from TCA &quot;We are still dealing with the repercussions of that event in this country, and some would argue that we had a huge overreaction to that event, as devastating as it was. Those are the issues that we&apos;re dealing with this season,&quot; he said. The series will also explore the intelligence community&apos;s responsibility to educate the new female president-elect , who Gansa described as being part Hillary Clinton, part Donald Trump and part Bernie Sanders. &quot;If you listen to Donald Trump, there are these people who run the government from administration to administration and they have completely screwed the world up,&quot; Gansa said. &quot;There is part of that in our president. There is also a little bit of Hillary, in terms of she&apos;s a pragmatist and knows Washington from the inside.&quot; Homeland Season 6 returns Sunday, Jan. 15 at 9/8c on Showtime.
