Fabric nightclub to close while police investigate two drug deaths 
The club will be shut this weekend as police carry out their investigation Friday 12 August 2016 06:56 BST The woman collapsed at Fabric in the early hours of Sunday morning 
Nightclub Fabric will close its doors this weekend as police investigate the drug-related deaths of two teenagers in six weeks. 
Scotland Yard has requested a temporary suspension of the iconic venue’s licence as it launches an inquiry into the fatalities. 
An 18-year-old collapsed outside the 2,500-capacity club in Farringdon on Saturday at 8.20am. He was taken to hospital where he died 40 minutes later. 
Another 18-year-old died in hospital after falling ill at the club at 2am on June 25. Polish pensioners speak out after raving until 5am at Fabric nightclub 
Neither death is being treated as suspicious but the club said it will shut over the weekend in order to: “understand how this happened”. 
The venue, which opened in 1999 and was once voted the best in the world by DJ magazine, narrowly escaped being shut down in December last year. 
It followed a request by the Met that Islington council “seriously consider” revoking its licence, citing four deaths in the previous three years. The notice on the nightclub&apos;s website 
Top DJs including Annie Mac, Chemical Brothers and Groove Armada signed a 30,000-name petition and closure was averted when managers agreed to strict licensing conditions, including sniffer dogs, ID scans and improved CCTV. 
A statement posted on the club’s website last night said: “For the past two years Fabric has operated without incident but tragically in the past nine [sic] weeks two 18-year-old boys have died as a consequence of drug overdoses. 
“In order to understand how this has happened we have agreed with the police and other agencies to suspend our operation whilst we investigate. The club will therefore be closed this weekend.” Read more Fabric nightclub wins appeal against use of sniffer dogs and ID scanners 
Steve Rolles, a policy analyst for Transform Drug Policy Foundation, said the recent deaths had to be a “wake up call” for both the clubbing scene and licensing authorities. 
He said: “Any drug-related death is a tragedy, and they are thankfully rare, but our current drug policy needs to make young people safe. 
“This has to be wake-up call because every fatality leaves the future of this club, which is a cultural instition and brings in millions of pounds to the economy, balancing on a knife edge.” 
An Islington Council spokesman said: “After two recent drug-related deaths, the Metropolitan Police has applied for an interim suspension of Fabric’s licence. This application is yet to be determined.” 
A Met spokesman said not arrests had been made in connection with either of the deaths and investigations continue. More about:
