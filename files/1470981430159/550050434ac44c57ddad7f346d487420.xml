Home » Going Out » DUBAI MINUTE: 10 utterly fun things to do in Dubai this weekend DUBAI MINUTE: 10 utterly fun things to do in Dubai this weekend Posted on 11.08.16 by Chandini Guria Making plans for the weekend? As always, Dubai Minute is here to help! Give us just 60 seconds and we’ll give you the best of what’s going on in Dubai this weekend. And here are a few more to try: 

Thursday: Get laughing – Laughter Factory 
Bring the laughs with funny guys Tom Wrigglesworth, Marlon Davies and Christian Schulte-Loh tonight and tomorrow at the Movenpick hotel, JBR! 
After the success of the previous tour, the boys are in Dubai for another hilarious tour – guaranteed to leave you in stitches. Sounds like the prefect way to kick off your weekend. 9pm, Movenpick JBR. More info here . Call 050 878 6728 to book. 

Thursday: Get chilled – Barasti Ice Bar 
Cooler than a penguin’s fridge, the Barasti Ice Bar opens its frosty doors tonight to bring some seriously needed cool to Dubai’s after dark scene. 
Chilled to a teeth-chattering minus 18 degrees Celsius, it’s an adult wonderland that’s accessible with the two purchases of a selected beverage. 
No need to dig out your woolies – snow jackets will be provided, because inside, absolutely everything is made of ice. Barasti, open daily. Sat-Weds 11am-1.30am. Thurs and Fri 11am-3am. www.barastibeach.com 

Friday: Get up and brunch – Midsummer Madness 
Take a break from the scorching heat, let loose and enjoy some midsummer madness at McGettigan’s JLT on Friday. 
The beach bar invites you all to come on down for its six-hour bumper brunch with unlimited selected beverages and a tasty a la carte menu, plus a buffet. Stick a fork in us! 
There will be live entertainment throughout the day, including performances from Mike Ross, Maplejacks, Schizophonik and Scott Forshaw! Starting from AED249, 12pm-6pm. E mail contact@mcgettigans.com to book. McGettigans JLT. 

Friday: Get singing – Karaoke night 
Are you ready for the second annual Karaoke Night at Gloria Hotel? Join in for a night full of fun, food, and lots of singing this Friday! 
If singing isn’t your thing, come along anyway for the laughs. It’s guaranteed to be a fun night for all ages, so feel free to bring a friend along and give your vocal chords a chance. 
Who knows, they might even surprise you. AED 50, including refreshments. Tickets will be available for sale on the day at the Gloria Hotel, Media City. 7pm onwards. 

Saturday: Get inverted – Yoga Aerobics 
Yogis and yoginis, come on down for a free 60-min Yoga Aerobics class on Saturday, with Mona Banki from Bikram Yoga Middle East. 
Targeted towards those who have some experience of practicing yoga, as this is a slightly more challenging class involving a good mix of cardio, deep stretching and bridges. 
All you need to do is download the Classport app, book yourself in for the free class and show up! Join the movement, and see you on the mat. 11am-12pm, Ripe Market – Times Square Centre. 

Saturday: Get shopping – The Change Initiative 
Sadly Dubai’s home of all things eco is closing its flagship store in Al Barsha 1. 
Although the planet-friendly ranges it sources will still be available at stores around Dubai, what’s currently in stock is being sold off, with prices cut by as much as 90 per cent. 
The store and cafe are set to close for good on 20th September, but bargains are sure to disappear fast. The Change Initiative, Al Barsha 1, near the Ibis Hotel.8am-8pm. www.facebook.com/TheChangeInitiative
