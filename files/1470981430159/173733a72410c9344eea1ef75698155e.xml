DALLAS -- It&apos;s a rarely-discussed segment of the homeless population: those who have a job, but don&apos;t have a home. 
Homeless shelters often have rigid hours that are difficult for those trying to work, like Nathan Bowles, 46. 
&quot;It&apos;s beyond stressful,&quot; Bowles said. 
He said he&apos;s been homeless over a year, after a serious leg injury left him with tens of thousands of dollars in medical bills. Eventually, he was out on the street.

&quot;I was sleeping on a mattress out in the woods,&quot; he said. 
More recently, Bowles has been staying at the Austin Street Center , a homeless shelter for men over 45 near downtown Dallas. To get a spot for the night, he has to line up everyday by 2 p.m. 
That&apos;s a problem, because this summer, Bowles got a job busing tables at the Omni Hotel. It&apos;s his first real job in over two years. 
&quot;It really meant a lot just to see the opportunity placed in front of me,&quot; he said. 
He said he works some late nights, and those new hours make it difficult for him to secure a spot at the shelter.

&quot;There&apos;s a distinct possibility they won&apos;t have my name down on a cot,&quot; Bowles said one afternoon as he got off of work and prepared to walk two miles to the shelter. 
Austin Street does have a program called workers&apos; cot, with 40 beds dedicated to the working homeless. If they can prove employment, they can get a guaranteed bed with flexible hours. But the program has been full for months, and Bowles said he was not able to get in.

&quot;There are dozens of people that have asked us for a worker&apos;s cot bed that we&apos;re not able to put in a bed, even though they&apos;re employed,&quot; said Daniel Roby, executive director of the Austin Street Center. Click here to learn more or donate to Austin Street Center 
He said about 10 percent of the shelter&apos;s available beds are designated for the program, but expanding would require additional funding. 
&quot;It&apos;s an enormous problem right now in Dallas,&quot; he said. &quot;There are hundreds of people I&apos;m certain that are employed and still currently homeless.&quot;
