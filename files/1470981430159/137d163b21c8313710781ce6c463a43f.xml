NEW YORK (AP) — A huge red-white-and-blue letter T in tribute to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has risen on a lawn days after a slightly smaller one was torched there. 
Artist Scott LoBaido knew he was being provocative when he erected the first 12-foot-high T on Trump supporter Sam Pirozzolo&apos;s lawn on Staten Island in May. But on Wednesday he was in shock over the arson attack last weekend. 
&quot;I&apos;m a patriotic activist promoting Americanism all over the country,&quot; LoBaido declared as he stood by his 16-foot-high new letter, almost as tall as Pirozzolo&apos;s house. 
Passing motorists honked and shouted their approval. 
LoBaido said the original T was his response to harassment of Trump supporters, including signs with Trump&apos;s name being pulled from their lawns. 
It&apos;s not the first time LoBaido&apos;s artworks have been defaced. Last year, a man was arrested on Staten Island for applying anti-Semitic and anti-government graffiti on the artist&apos;s American flags, which he&apos;s been painting on Veterans of Foreign Wars posts around the country. 
LoBaido himself was arrested in 1999 for hurling horse manure at the Brooklyn Museum, protesting a show he deemed anti-Christian, with elephant dung applied to an image of Mary. In 2001, he was thrown out for displaying a painting of the museum director facing a pig&apos;s rump, ready to bite it. 
For the T installation, he used latex paint on foam insulation, resting on a surviving wooden support that&apos;s charred black. 
Investigators are trying to determine who sneaked up under cover of darkness and set fire to the original T on Sunday. 
Pirozzolo, who was awakened at about 1 a.m. when a passing motorist knocked on his door to alert him about the fire, said he blames &quot;pro-Hillary Clinton thugs.&quot; 
As the Trump tribute went up in flames, he said, &quot;the first thing that came to my mind was, &apos;Oh, my God, this is like the Ku Klux Klan burning a cross on my lawn, telling me that I have to shut up.&apos;&quot; 
Instead, Pirozzolo and the artist set to work the next day, assembling another installation. 
Pirozzolo said Trump called to thank them for their show of support. Pirozzolo&apos;s wife and two teenage kids listened in. 
On Tuesday, hundreds of people appeared in the street after the new T went up, singing &quot;God Bless America&quot; and criticizing Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee. A few Trump haters used a megaphone to shout insults.
