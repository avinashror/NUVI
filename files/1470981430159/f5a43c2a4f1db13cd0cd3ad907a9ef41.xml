Open Create News Feed Indicator 
This includes for All Pairs, CFDs, Indicies, Futures. 
Once I attach the indicator I should be able to see the following: 
For the given pair, any: 
High Impact News: time until it is to occur 
Medium Impact News: time until it is to occur 
Low Impact News: time until it is to occur 
All news on each chart should only be related to the specific pair SUBMIT DATE
