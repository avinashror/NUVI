Airline officials say they called for help after a passenger was found stowing a monkey in his shirt during a Las Vegas-bound flight. 
Airline officials say they called for help after a passenger was found stowing a monkey in his shirt during a Las Vegas-bound flight. 
Frontier Airlines spokesman Richard Oliver says the incident happened Tuesday night on a flight from Columbus, Ohio, to Las Vegas. 
Oliver says the passenger broke policy by not informing the airline that he was bringing a service animal onboard, and then refused to turn over documents verifying the monkey&apos;s status. 
McCarran International Airport spokeswoman Christine Crews says law enforcement officials met up with the plane and determined that the monkey was a certified service animal. 
Oliver says the animal was brought surreptitiously onto the plane in a duffel bag and never became loose or uncontained during the flight. 
It wasn&apos;t immediately clear whether the passenger faces consequences.
