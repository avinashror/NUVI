LAKEWOOD’S LIVE on the LAKE Family night is CANCELLED TONIGHT! (8/11/16) August 11th, 2016 
Contributed Article 
Live on the Lake Lakewood, NY (08/11/16) – Due to the nature of this type of FAMILY entertainment and the continued forecast for thunderstorms passing through the area, Lakewood officials have decided to reschedule. NEW DATE IS Thursday August 25 ! New time: 5:30 – 8:30 due to earlier sunsets. The Big Horn Meats truck will also be back, and the Lakewood Events and Marketing Committee will hold a short ceremony just ahead of the performance for those who volunteered for our 4th of July Summerfest. So, Marty’s Bubblegum Machine, and juggler Geoff Bach will perform TWO WEEKS from tonight at the Richard O. Hartley park in Lakewood. Mark your calendars! Previous article
