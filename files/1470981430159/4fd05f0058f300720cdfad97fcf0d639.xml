She is best known for playing superhero Hit Girl.

&apos;Keeping her safe&apos;: Brooklyn Beckham took to Instagram on Thursday to share this photo of himself carrying girlfriend Chloe Grace Moretz
Chloe could be seen snapping the picture over Brooklyn&apos;s shoulder as he captioned it: &apos;Keeping her safe [heart emoji]&apos;
In the snap taken in a reflection, both could be seen wearing all black while entering a doorway.
The two have been quite showy with their love on social media as Chloe took to the picture-sharing social network to post a topless photo.
The Kick-Ass star&apos;s bare back could be seen as she laid out on the sand in Laguna Beach.
Beach babe: The 17-year-old&apos;s girlfriend Chloe, 19, posted a black-and-white topless snap he took of her on Wednesday
Her boyfriend Brooklyn took the artsy snap as she gave him photo credit in the caption. 

The son of soccer star David didn&apos;t upload the photo, instead posting a second black and white shot of the actress wearing a bikini under an open white shirt. 

Their relaxing day comes after the couple - who have been enjoying time together during the Brit&apos;s stint in LA - have reportedly been in talks for their own reality show. 
Flawless photo: Brooklyn also posted his own stunning image of the beautiful blonde on the same day
Brooklyn and Chloe are reportedly in the midst of a bidding war between networks who are &apos;desperate&apos; to sign them up, and are willing to pay &apos;millions&apos; to persuade them to act out their life on screen. 
A source told Heat: &apos;MTV and E! are both interested, apparently. They&apos;re prepared to offer them millions - they think it would be TV gold.&apos;
