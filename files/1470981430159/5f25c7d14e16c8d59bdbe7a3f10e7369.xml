DPWH implements 24/7 round-the-clock construction Text: Eric Tipan / Photos: AutoIndustriya.com | posted August 12, 2016 11:59 Four key projects in Metro Manila on the clock 
Ever notice how various road works around the metro has taken ‘forever’ to get done causing traffic and flooding in the process? 
This may all soon come to an end after the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) implemented a program as per the mandate of President Rodrigo Duterte to have the agency finish projects on time. 
In response, the DPWH has rolled out the ‘24/7 construction’, which aims to have non-stop construction, day and night, for seven days a week until the project sees completion. 
“We have a traffic crisis we intend to solve in the next two to three years. The Philippines has had an infrastructure deficit in the last four decades. There is a clamor not only to address the deficiencies but also to propose an infrastructure program that would eventually ease traffic in our major urban centers,” said DPWH Secretary Mark Villar. 
Four project in Metro Manila have been put under this program - the Mandaluyong Main Drainage Project, the road widening and drainage improvement in Quezon Avenue East Bound and in Mother Ignacia, and the drainage improvement along EDSA from White Plains to Main Avenue. 
Highly populated urban areas in the Visayas and Mindanao will follow suit and are set to implement the program on ‘high-impact projects.’ 
To help speed up the construction process, the DPWH will be using one-day concrete on areas like EDSA. 
“Infrastructure delayed is infrastructure denied. Mechanisms will soon be in place to ensure that projects are built on time. Our vision is to make our communities liveable and safe through quality projects that are accessible, and on-schedule,” added Villar. Related Articles
