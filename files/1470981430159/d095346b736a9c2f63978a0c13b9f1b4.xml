GRAND RAPIDS, MICH. - It&apos;s no secret that Grand Rapids is a foodie town, but did you know that most of our great local restaurants are using ingredients right from our own backyard? 
&quot;Some people don&apos;t realize how local it really is.&quot; 
Gabe Araujo is the executive chef at Harmony Hall. He takes pride in using local produce and meat products, &quot;Our cabbage is locally sources from Michigan our carrots. 
&quot;The bacon, if we can&apos;t make it in house, we&apos;ll locally source it. Sometimes we make our own bacon in house. Our sweet peppers are sourced locally our cauliflower our corn.&quot; 
All of it coming from local farms like Green Wagon Farm in Ada. 
&quot;They fund us up front and in return they get to plan any food they want in their beds. And we manage it for them and they get the harvest. So it&apos;s kind of a nice relationship.&quot; Heather Anderson and her husband Chad own the farm. They started out selling at Farmer&apos;s Markets, then added Community Supported Agriculture and now local restaurants. 
&quot;I was like hey what if we got a bed for them allowed them to grow whatever they wanted and we could charge a fee for that. And that&apos;s where I got the idea and Harmony heard about it and picked it up.&quot; Anderson says they now grow for up to 10 restaurants in Kent County. 
Each restaurant decides what they&apos;d like to grow on their lot of plan, “We put together a planting schedule for them like we do for ourselves and worked with whatever varieties they wanted to grow.&quot; 
&quot;We just finished curing our garlic in the greenhouse and they&apos;re clearing that out that was in there for a few weeks and now we&apos;ve got the onions going in,&quot; Anderson says as she points out the farmers working in the onion field. 
And those onions are going right from the farm to your plate. 
“Living in Michigan, we have such an incredible resource readily available for us why not use it,&quot; says Araujo. 
Restaurant Week runs through Aug. 21, 2016. 
There are over 60 restaurants are participating in the Earth to Table theme this year.
