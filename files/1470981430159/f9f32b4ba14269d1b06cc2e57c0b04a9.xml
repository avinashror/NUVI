Same actors, new set: Britain again seeks 3 golds in 1 day 
By RAF CASERT 
RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) -- In British sporting lore, it&apos;s known as &quot;Super Saturday.&quot; 
This weekend comes the sequel. Same actors, different set. 
Mo Farah, Jessica Ennis-Hill and Greg Rutherford won gold medals within an hour of each other at the 2012 London Games, creating one of the biggest roars in Olympic history. 
By luck or planning, all three will be competing for gold during the same session again at the Rio de Janeiro Games, and again on a Saturday evening. 
&quot;We all come here strongly,&quot; said Rutherford, who won the long jump after Ennis-Hill won the heptathlon and before Farah took gold in the 10,000 meters. 
Farah credited the lift he got from his two teammates and the Union Jack-waving fans. 
It still brings a smile to Rutherford&apos;s face, too. At the time, he was the odd one out amid two of the biggest British performers. It elevated him to star status. 
&quot;It&apos;s the greatest sporting achievement in my career,&quot; he said ahead of this year&apos;s Olympics. &quot;If it wasn&apos;t for the other two I was sandwiched between, it wouldn&apos;t have been Super Saturday.&quot; 
If they all win again, it won&apos;t be in the same order. Depending how long it takes to finish the long jump, it will be either Rutherford or Farah to finish first. Ennis-Hill will be last, running the 800 meters that caps the heptathlon after 11 p.m. -- 3 a.m. in Britain. 
Here&apos;s a look at what chances each has to make it another &quot;Super Saturday&quot;: 
JESSICA ENNIS-HILL/HEPTATHLON: So much has happened to her over the past years, especially off the track. She added a hyphen to her name after marriage and gave birth to son Reggie in 2014. She came back and won the world title last year. And she won her only heptathlon so far this year. Brianne Theisen-Eaton of Canada, who took silver behind Ennis-Hill, has the top mark of the season. Ennis-Hill, however, knows how to win, and has claimed four other major titles beyond her Olympic gold. Theisen-Eaton has won only one world indoor title. 
MO FARAH/10,000: How could you to bet against Farah? In the wake of Ethiopian greats Haile Gebrselassie and Kenenisa Bekele, it has been Farah who has dominated long-distance running for the last four years. Double 5,000-10,000 gold in London, double gold at the 2013 worlds, double gold at the 2015 worlds. He has not lost a major race since taking silver in the 10,000 at the 2011 worlds. Kenyans and Ethiopians will challenge, but Farah, carrying no injury with him in Rio, will be the man with the most to lose. 
GREG RUTHERFORD/LONG JUMP: The odd man out in 2012 has grown into his role as champion and has a Grand Slam of titles -- Olympic, world, Commonwealth and European -- coming into Rio. He rarely excels jumping furthest in a full season, but on any big night, he is tough to beat. He only is the seventh best performer this season, but it doesn&apos;t matter, only Saturday counts. It makes for a very open competition, where he will face Americans who have dominated the season. 
&quot;I&apos;m in very good shape myself and I believe the other two are in fantastic shape, too,&quot; said Rutherford, who won gold at the European championships last month. &quot;So it&apos;s very, very possible.&quot;
