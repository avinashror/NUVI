Fiji wins first-ever men’s rugby sevens gold medal NBC Olympics.com Published: Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) 
Fiji won the first-ever Olympic men’s rugby sevens gold medal by defeating Great Britain 43-7 on Thursday. 
Fiji’s Osea Kolinisau scored a try less than a minute into the match. Jerry Tuwai, Jasa Veremalua, Leone Nakarawa and Vatemo Ravouvou added tries to send Fiji into halftime leading 29-0. 
Dan Norton scored Great Britain’s only try. 
It was the first Olympic medal for Fiji in any sport. 
This was the inaugural Olympic men’s rugby sevens tournament. Rugby was last played at the Olympics in 1924, when men played the 15-a-side version of the sport. 
South Africa put on an offensive display in the Bronze Medal Match, defeating Japan 54-14. It was the most points scored by any team in a match in Rio. Rosko Specman had a hat trick for South Africa. 
Japan was the tournament’s biggest surprise, having entered as the 10th seed out of 12 teams. 
Earlier on Thursday, the U.S. men’s rugby team defeated Spain 24-12 to finish ninth in the final Olympic standings. Share this:
