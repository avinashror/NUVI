COMET To Expand Bus Routes Through Northeast Changes could be coming to COMET routes. Loren Thomas, wltx 10:23 PM. EST August 11, 2016 Routes 15 and 5 could be changed if new routes are confirmed. (Photo: WLTX) 
Columbia, SC (WLTX) - If you ride The COMET Bus along Forest Drive you could see extra stops along the way if new routes are confirmed. 
A public meeting was held on Thursday night to get feedback from riders on the proposed changes. &quot;This is a proposal that will take the four buses currently on routes 5 and 15 and reuse them slightly,&quot; says Samuel Scheib, transit planner for the COMET. &quot;It&apos;s part of a larger planning effort where we are concentrating more resources in denser parts of town and less resources in less dense parts of the community as away to better use our resources to increase the efficiency of our service.&quot; 
The new routes, which could go into effect in May of 2017, would focus on getting more services out to the Northeast side of Columbia. &quot;It concentrates the service on Forest Drive and then there&apos;s what&apos;s called a connection protection zone where other routes meet that same vehicle,&quot; says Scheib. 
One of the new routes would ride along Decker Blvd, heading towards Farrow Rd. and serving those trying to get to Midlands Tech&apos;s Northeast Campus. Timothy Shaw, a Columbia resident, says he could benefit from these changes. &quot;It&apos;s just making the buses better for people to catch,&quot; says Shaw. &quot;I can catch two buses to go to Parklane now. I really like the routes right now and don&apos;t have any complaints about it. 
Scheib says changes would be cost neutral, meaning they would shift buses to fit the new routes without having to add longer hours to the service. 
This saves money when it comes to the the Richland County Penny Tax. According to their website, the comet receives 29 percent of the proceeds. &quot;Just because we passed the penny doesn&apos;t mean we have unlimited resources,&quot; says Scheib. &quot;So creating efficiency is really essential for us to grow and expand in other parts of the community.&quot;
