Denmark, SC (WLTX) -The new president of Voorhees College has big plans for the small school in Denmark. 
Dr. Franklin Evans who previously served as interim president at South Carolina State University says he wants to increase enrollment, fundraising and alumni engagement at Voorhees. 
“It was God, it really was,” Evans says it’s destiny that he’s Voorhees’ new leader. “I was honored and certainly humbled by the invitation to meet with board members that they actually had been thinking about me for the position.” 
“We’ve got to do some things differently in order to go out there and seal the deal with our students,” Evans explained. 
The school has about 450 students, he wants that number to go up to 700 in two years. 
“I’m anticipating fundraising is going to increase significantly that we are going to reengage alumni and that we’re going to bring in some corporate sponsors some other donors,” the new leader said. “We’ve got employees that have been here for a while and have not seen a large increase in pay raises and those kinds of things and so I’ve got to be cognizant of the fact that we need some morale boosters.” 
He also says the school will have online classes and will hopefully build partnerships with Boening and BMW. 
He helped South Carolina State get a balanced budget, more students and off their accreditation probation. 
He says he’s using his previous experience to help move the school forward. 
“My vision for Voorhees is to be a premiere liberal arts institution that people hear about, that people know about, that it will be the school of choice for students, not an option,” Evans said. “We’re going to put out all the great and wonderful things that Voorhees is about that students will be flocking to come here.” 
Evans says that he is also looking to build stronger ties with the school’s Episcopal Church affiliation. 
He replaces Dr. Cleveland Sellers who is leaving the job for health reasons.
