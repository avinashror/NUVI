PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- Chase Rice’s style is simple: Take him or leave him. Lately, most seem to be opting for the former as the rising country star’s name has been bandied about for awards and his songs are hitting heartstrings and engendering new fans. The singer-songwriter from North Carolina lays it all out when he sings, and even when he speaks. In a phone interview from “somewhere in Iowa” recently, he&apos;s proud of his slow and steady climb through the industry ranks, and the connection he makes with his fans during live shows. “[On stage] you’re gonna be mine and I’m gonna be yours for an hour and a half,” he says. “We’re gonna be in each other’s face. If you don’t like that, walk out the door. I’m looking for people who are looking to have the best night of their entire life. If you aren’t here to party, I’m gonna make you party!” It’s been his style all along — when he was playing to 20 people, then 120, and now preparing for his Iowa audience of roughly 3,000 that night. The slow rise keeps him grounded. “It’s how I wanted it to happen — slowly building fans who are yours from the beginning,” he says. “I don’t want to miss out on the whole damn thing, and all of a sudden look up and think, ‘When did I arrive?’” Rice credits playing football as a youth and then through college, as a linebacker at the University of North Carolina, with preparing him for the hard work required of a successful musician. “I lived a normal life before all this!” he says, laughing. “I learned to focus on the steps that get you there from football.” Brash and proud, he also notes that his mother has stepped in when “I started down roads I shouldn’t have.” “Any time you throw fame into someone’s life, it can screw it up,” he admits. Rice, who&apos;s been touring fairs and festivals all summer, says his latest song, “ Everybody We Know Does ,” embodies the simplicity he likes to maintain in corners of his life — with lyrics like “Not everybody likes a Friday night covered in dust/But everybody we know does” — even as he becomes famous. “It’s more me than any other song I’ve ever done before. It’s how I was growing up and it’s like how I am on my farm in Tennessee now,” he says. “The crazy part is that I didn’t write it, even though I write most of my songs.” It was his writing, in fact, that helped spark the chart-busting Florida Georgia Line hit “ Cruise .” He’s also written much of “Ignite the Night,” his latest album, which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Country Albums chart and No. 3 on the all-genre chart. His promotional materials note that the album “tackles tube tops and tears in equal measure” with songs that crisscross genres. “Ride” is solidly &quot;bro&quot; country — songs about fast trucks, women and drinking — in tempo and style while an electronic rock backbone supports “Ready Set Rock” and “50 Shades of Crazy.” “Do It Like This” has a hip-hop flavor, and his sentimental side comes through on others like “Carolina Can.” “I wanted to push this album to a whole other level,” he says. “The sales and crowd singing back to me show that I am doing something right. And I can just keep giving the cold shoulder to popular opinion. “I don’t care if people call me bro country or they call me hip-hop or rock. All I care about is if I walk onstage and people are screaming every word back to me.” Those are the songs that sustain people, Rice says, reflecting on his own memories of music heard in back road honky tonks while line dancing. He ticks off a short list that includes “Copperhead Road,” “Amazing Grace,” “Sweet Home Alabama” and “Anything But Mine” as key in his memory bank. “We all have memories of things we used to do and songs that helped us through those times. The biggest hope of any artist is to have a song that people treasure like that,” he says. His live shows are energetic and country rogue, following Garth Brooks and &quot;highway outlaws&quot; like Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson and Johnny Cash in style. “They didn’t call themselves that,” he says of the outlaws. “They were that because they basically gave the finger to everyone telling them how to do it. Garth, the same thing: he wanted his live show to be like Kiss.” Chase Rice performs at the Alex and Ani City Center, 2 Kennedy Plaza, Providence, on Friday, Aug. 19, at 6:30 p.m. For tickets, which are $34 apiece, go to www.ticketmaster.com . —Susan McDonald is a regular contributor to The Providence Journal.
