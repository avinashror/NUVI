Iran sweeps Cuba to keep hopes of a quarterfinals appearance alive 
Iran men’s volleyball can still dream about a possible medal at the Rio Olympics. 
After getting swept out of the gym by Argentina on Day 1 of prelims, Iran came back and fought – almost literally – for a point against Poland. 
They needed a strong performance Thursday and they got it, sweeping Cuba in three sets ( 25-21, 31-29, 25-16 ). 
Shahram Mahmoudi led the way for Iran with 19 points and three blocks while Adel Gholami notched 11 points and three blocks and Seyed Mohammad Mousavi Eraghi collected 12 points and five blocks. 
The sweep gives Iran the fourth spot in Pool B, one point ahead of Egypt. 
Cuba is all but eliminated after losing nine of the 10 sets it has played in Rio, sitting last in the Pool with zero points through three matches. 
Iran is ranked No. 10 in the world, while Cuba sits at 17th. 
Russia easily handles Egypt 
Eygpt’s up-and-down Olympics continued Thursday on the wrong end of a three-set sweep. 
On Day 1 of prelims, Egypt lost all three sets to Poland, then came back and swept Cuba before losing all three sets to Russia Thursday morning ( 25-11, 25-17, 25-9 ). 
The match took barely 50 minutes to complete as the No. 3 team in the world dominated. 
It was the first sweep of the Olympics for Russia, which beat Cuba (3-1) on the first day and lost to Argentina (3-1) on Day 2 of prelims. 
The sweep gives Russia six points in the preliminary stage, essentially assuring them a spot in the quarterfinals round. 
Egypt is ranked 20th in the world. Share this:
