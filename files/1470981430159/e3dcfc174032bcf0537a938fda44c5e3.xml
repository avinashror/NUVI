National Dig Safe day reminds everyone to call 811 before digging Dig safe is a free service, but it&apos;s the law Nick Bannin Published: August 11, 2016, 4:16 pm Updated: Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) 
CHICOPEE, Mass. (WWLP) – Thursday is Dig Safe Day, which exists to remind you to call 811 when you dig into the ground. 
If you’re planting, building, or even just installing a mailbox, Columbia gas reminds you to call 811 first. 
The gas, water, phone and any other underground wiring will then be marked like these lines are, so you can avoid contact with the pipes or cables when you dig. 
Dig safe is a free service, but it’s the law. 
Just call at least 3 days before you dig. Share this:
