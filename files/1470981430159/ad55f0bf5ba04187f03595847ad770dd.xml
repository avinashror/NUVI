Actress Prachi Desai says she feels heartbroken when any of her films don’t do really well. 
“A film not doing well is extremely heart-breaking (for me)… I know we repeatedly say that ‘You have no idea how much effort goes into every film’, but trust me a lot of our time, hope and effort is riding on the film and it becomes a part of us,” Prachi told IANS over phone from Mumbai. 
“You spend so much time with the people, role and everything about that film. Personally, I will say it is very heart-breaking for me if a film doesn’t do as well, she added. Prachi was last seen on screen in the biographical-sports drama Azhar, where she was seen portraying the role of Naureen, first wife of former cricketer Mohammad Azharuddin. 
Her next Bollywood outing will be the musical drama Rock On!! 2. It also stars Farhan Akhtar, Arjun Rampal, Purab Kohli and Shraddha Kapoor. Earlier, actress Prachi Desai said that she is keen to essay astronaut Kalpana Chawla and the late Maharani Gayatri Devi of Jaipur on-screen. × Asked whom would she like to portray in a biopic, Prachi told IANS: “There would be plenty… Actually there are two that I can name right now because they are drastically different. One would be Kalpana Chawla and the other would be Gayatri Devi.” 
Prachi, who shared screen space with actor Emraan Hashmi for the second time in Azhar, which will premiere on Sony Max on August 14, says both the persons are “amazingly different”. IANS
