EPA’s science advisers challenge agency report on the safety of fracking The Washington Post 5 hrs ago Chris Mooney, Steven Mufson, Brady Dennis In this March 29, 2013, file photo, workers tend to a well head during a hydraulic fracturing operation outside Rifle, in western Colorado. (AP Photo/Brennan Linsley, File) Science advisers to the Environmental Protection Agency Thursday challenged an already controversial government repor t on whether thousands of oil and gas wells that rely on hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking,” systemically pollute drinking water across the nation.
That EPA report, many years in the making and still not finalized, had concluded, “We did not find evidence that these mechanisms have led to widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water resources in the United States,” adding that while there had been isolated problems, those were “small compared to the number of hydraulically fractured wells.”
The conclusion was widely cited and interpreted to mean that while there may have been occasional contamination of water supplies, it was not a nationwide problem. Many environmental groups faulted the study , even as industry groups hailed it.
But the 30-member advisory panel on Thursday concluded the agency’s report was “comprehensive but lacking in several critical areas.”
It recommended that the report be revised to include “quantitative analysis that supports its conclusion” — if, indeed, the conclusion can be defended.
The panel said its critique was backed by 26 of its members, but four dissented. The advisory group is comprised of academic, government, and industry scientists.
The EPA report in question was originally requested by Congress in 2010, when one of the principal environmental concerns centered on whether fracking could contaminate drinking supplies. Since then, other environmental questions — including concerns over methane emissions from drilling operations — have also gained prominence.
The report, published in June of last year in draft form, represents a nearly five-year effort by the EPA to analyze technical data from thousands from fracking operations and nearby aquifers in states around the country.
The study has been dogged by controversy over the scope and scale of the research. The draft study linked fracking to a few cases of water pollution but said the problems appeared so far to be isolated. It cautioned that a number of fracking-related activities carry a future risk of polluting wells and aquifers used for drinking and farming.
The EPA acknowledged last year that it was hampered in its assessment by inadequate data, preventing experts from reaching firm conclusions about whether contaminants in an individual well came from fracking or another source. Some critics of the report said poor data skewed the agency’s conclusions.
The Sierra Club hailed the Science Advisory Board critique, saying it “called out” the agency. “Instead of blindly allowing destructive fracking to continue in our communities, we should extend statewide fracking bans and moratoriums that will keep dirty, climate-polluting fossil fuels like fracked gas in the ground.”
Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, refers to oil and gas wells that are drilled deep in the ground and then horizontally. After that, water containing some chemicals is blasted at high pressure into the well to fracture the rock, unlocking previously trapped natural gas or oil that then flows back up the well.
This technology has driven a major domestic U.S. oil and gas boom that has contributed to the recent plunge in oil prices and triggered the collapse of the coal industry. But there have also been widespread claims that major fracking operations in some communities have contaminated drinking water with methane gas or other substances.
“EPA will use the [science advisory board’s] final comments and suggestions, along with relevant literature published since the release of the draft assessment, and public comments received by the agency, to revise and finalize the assessment,” agency spokeswoman Melissa Harrison said in a statement. “EPA appreciates the work done by the SAB and hopes to finalize the assessment in 2016.”

you can blame 2 groups of people for our still high gas prices well 3 actually. 1st and formost those unethical speculators who set the price of crude based on world happenings even when we are pumping our own oil. 2nd is the oil companies who still keep jacking the price up and up to keep share holders happy nothing more . even in my area 90% of our stations hover around 2.00-2.40 a gal. but i have seen some who put regular at $2.35 and all others at $3 50+ a gallon for nothing but to screw the public. and 3rd our government for allowing the decades of price rigging at the pump to maximize profits to both the station and shareholders. OPEC today has no influance when it comes to US prices like they use to we pump for ourselves and have so much oil it is sickning when i pull up to the pump and see how much it costs. fracking has created such a surplus of both oil and gas OPEC is dieing because we no long buy from them. the EPA serves a purpose and killing jobs is a lie put forth by the oil and gas industry and the far right wack jobs. who claim coal is good to all. fracking does impact the lands but not to the extent some claim. i know quit a few people involved in fracking and it is the companies that back flush the bad chemicals into the wells that are the problem not the process if done the way it is intended. as far as our air and water being fine i suggest you visit a few of the super fund sites and see just what happens when corps are left unchecked and what happens to the land water and people as a direct result. your and idiot to claim otherwise. whole towns have been vacated and generations of kids either grew up malformed or dead because of corperations doing what they wanted not what the EPA mandated or toxic dumping and the likes ok with you? i suggest you educate yourself on these thing instead of listening to fox news
