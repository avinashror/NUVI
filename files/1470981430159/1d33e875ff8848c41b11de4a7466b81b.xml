The Mineral Fire, burning outside of Coalinga, has now burned nearly 7000 acres and is 15% contained. More than 1,000 personnel are battling the blaze that began Tuesday. The Mineral Fire has destroyed one structure and prompted evacuation orders for those on Coalinga Mineral Springs Road. Non-mandatory evacuation warnings are also in place for residents in Los Gatos Canyon. 
Cal Fire’s Stacey Nolan says the steep terrain is to explain for the fire growing almost 2-thousand acres in size from Wednesday to Thursday. She says it hampers emergency crews from battling the blaze. 
There is good news – Nolan says Highway 198 is now open at Firestone Road. 
The Red Cross has an evacuation center set up at West Hills College in Coalinga. Large animals are being taken in at the college’s rodeo grounds. 
The cause of the Mineral Fire remains under investigation.
