MINNEAPOLIS - A Stadium Village institution is closing its doors after four decades of business. 
Village Wok, a favorite stop for many University of Minnesota students, announced Wednesday they would be closing within the month. 
In a post on its Facebook page, the business states they are sad to make the announcement but so grateful for all the dedicated customers they&apos;ve had over the years. 
Their last day will be Sunday, Aug 21. The restaurant, along with the Big Ten, Bun Mi, and Espresso Expose will shut down to make room for new apartments. But not all hope is lost. Longtime Village Wok manager Francisco Vuong-Deo-Campo said they plan to re-open in the same spot when the apartments are complete. However, the others will not re-open. 
“It’s kind of sad. It feels like the ending is near but I look forward because I want to see what’s there in the future,” he said.
