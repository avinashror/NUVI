Key matchups 
Canada vs. USA (women) 
Coming off of yet another record-setting performance in the Rio Olympics, the U.S. face their toughest test yet in an undefeated Canadian team. This U.S. team looks to rival even the 1996 U.S. Olympic team, often referred to as the dream team of women’s hoops, in terms of talent and sheer domination. In their previous game, they became the first women’s team to score 100 points in three consecutive games. Canada will present a good test to see if the U.S. has faced weak competition or if they will waltz through this tournament in rare form. 
Keep an eye on Canada’s Kia Nurse in this game. Nurse plays collegiately for Team USA’s Geno Auriemma at the University of Connecticut. She won the national championship twice playing for Auriemma and alongside Breanna Stewart. 
USA vs. Serbia (men) 
The U.S. eked out a victory over Australia in their last game in what was easily the most competitive game the U.S. has played in Rio. For a team most consider the gold medal favorite, the Australia win was a big test to see if the United States could pull off a win against a team that has significantly more experience playing together. 
Coming off of such an emotional victory, the U.S. must be careful not to take the matchup with Serbia for granted. With every team gunning to knock off the U.S., an unfocused squad could be upset by an upstart Serbian squad. Share this:
