Women’s synchronized 3m springboard 
Gold — China — Wu Minxia &amp; Shi Tingmao Silver — Italy — Tania Cagnotto &amp; Francesca Dellapé Bronze — Australia — Maddison Keeney &amp; Anabelle Smith 
Wu set five Olympic records with her gold medal in the synchronized springboard as the Chinese distanced themsevles from the field. Wu now owns the records for the most diving gold medals by an individual (five), the most diving medals won by a woman (seven), the most gold medals in a single event (four in women’s synchronized 3m springboard), the most Olympics Games with a diving medal (four — tied with Canada’s Emilie Heymans), and the oldest woman to win diving gold (30). 
Cagnotto, 31, has been competing in Olympic diving events since the 2000 Games. After missing out on two medals by the narrowest of margins in London last time, the daughter of four-time diving medalist Giorgio Cagnotto finally reached the podium this year, adding a silver medal to the family heirlooms. 
Men’s synchronized 3m springboard 
Gold — Great Britain — Jack Laugher &amp; Chris Mears Silver — USA — Sam Dorman &amp; Michael Hixon Bronze — China — Cao Yuan &amp; Qin Kai 
A strong list from start to finish executed by Laugher and Mears earned Great Britain its first ever gold medal in Olympic diving. It also snapped China’s streak of synchronized victories, which dated back to a wild men’s synchronized springboard in the 2004 Athens Games. 
Dorman and Hixon, competing in just their second major event together, nailed their final dive to leapfrog the Chinese and log the USA’s best ever finish in the men’s 3m. 
Women’s synchronized 10m platform 
Gold — China — Chen Ruolin &amp; Liu Huixia Silver — Malaysia — Pandelela Rinong Pamg &amp; Cheong Jun Hoong Bronze — Canada — Meaghan Benfeito &amp; Roseline Filion 
Chen would have become the greatest champion in Olympic diving history were it not for countrywoman Wu’s gold medal two days prior. Chen, 23, and Wu, 30, are now tied with the most diving gold medals by an individual in Olympic history. Chen is an impressive five-for-five, amassing her record-setting five gold medals in just five career Olympic events. Americans Amy Cozad and Jessica Parratto, making their Olympic debut, placed seventh. 
Men’s synchronized 10m platform 
Gold — China — Chen Aisen &amp; Lin Yue Silver — USA — David Boudia &amp; Steele Johnson Bronze — Great Britain — Thomas Daley &amp; Daniel Goodfellow 
Chen and Lin dominated the men’s 10m event with an Olympic record point total of 496.98, receing a number of 10s in their program. 
Americans Boudia and Johnson, however, put together an impressive list to record the United State’s best ever finish in the event. Boudia, alongside partner Nick McCrory, set the previous mark with a bronze medal in 2012. 
SETTING UP THE INDIVIDUAL EVENTS 
Unlike the synchronized events, which go straight to the final, all four individual diving events include a preliminary and semifinal round to tee up the final. 
Men perform six dives in each round while the women perform five. 
The top 18 divers advance from the preliminary to the semifinal and the top 12 divers from the semifinal advance to the final. 
Scores do not carry over from round to round with the top three point totals in the final deciding the medalists. 
If there is a tie for 18th in the preliminary or for 12th in the semifinal, both divers advance.
