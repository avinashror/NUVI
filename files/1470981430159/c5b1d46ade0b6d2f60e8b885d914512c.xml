Phelps ready to spend more time with son Boomer Michael Phelps on preparing for his Olympic return in Rio. USA TODAY Sports Alec McQuade, WXIA 10:31 PM. EDT August 11, 2016 TOPSHOT - USA&apos;s Michael Phelps (L) holds his son Boomer after he won the Men&apos;s 200m Butterfly Final during the swimming event at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games at the Olympic Aquatics Stadium in Rio de Janeiro on August 9, 2016. / AFP / Martin BUREAU (Photo credit should read MARTIN BUREAU/AFP/Getty Images) (Photo: MARTIN BUREAU, This content is subject to copyright.) 
Michael Phelps is nearing the end of his Olympic career, so he says. 
We&apos;ve heard that before, but this time it is probably for real. 
When Phelps won the 21st Gold medal of his Olympic career by winning the 200-meter butterfly Tuesday, Phelps went over to his family in the stands to celebrate. 
He had a moment with his mother, Deborah, like we have seen so many times throughout the years. Her face filled with joy as she gave him a kiss. 
But then, there was another moment. One we had never seen before reminding us that Phelps is now all grown up. The moment with his son, Boomer. 
Phelps&apos; fianc√©, Nicole, held Boomer out to him, and he gave him a kiss. 
It was a moment that makes Phelps emotional, now, whenever he thinks about it. 
&quot;You&apos;re going to bring tears to my eyes,&quot; Phelps said in an interview with NBC Wednesday when bringing up the moment. 
&quot;I want to be with him more. So being able to share that one moment that I had with him, definitely very special,&quot; he said with his voice quivering. 
The cameras were everywhere while Phelps embraced Boomer. There are pictures of that moment from just about every angle imaginable. Phelps wants some copies. 
&quot;Looking forward to seeing more photos of that.&quot; 
Here you go, Phelps. Enjoy:
