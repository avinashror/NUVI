(NBC News) Trump grabbed headlines Thursday after charging that Hillary Clinton and President Obama are “the founders of ISIS.” 
President Obama is bombing ISIS and vowing to destroy it, but Trump continues to claim that ISIS is honoring the president, doubling down today and affirming his claim was not figurative but literal. 
He explained that Clinton backed the invasion of Iraq and Obama pulled us forces out, allowing ISIS to grow. 
Clinton presented her major economic speech Thursday in Michigan, promising a $225 billion jobs program, most of that private money, tuition free college for the middle class, profit sharing for workers, and tax hikes on the wealthy, Wall Street and big corporations. 
Clinton is surging in the polls, but Trump told CNBC he’s sticking with his game-plan and that he thinks he will win. 
“And in the end it is either going to work or I am going to, you know, have a very, very nice, long vacation,” Trump said.
