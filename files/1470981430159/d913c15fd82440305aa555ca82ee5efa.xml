LOS ANGELES (AP) — Disney&apos;s first Latino princess will keep her throne: The TV series &quot;Elena of Avalor&quot; is getting a second-season renewal. 
The decision was announced Thursday, shortly after the July debut of the animated series on Disney Channel and Disney Junior. 
Disney had already demonstrated its confidence in the project with extensive merchandise tie-ins, including dolls, books, accessories, a soundtrack and upcoming DVD. The Princess Elena character was introduced at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, on Thursday and will make her bow at the Disneyland Resort in California this fall. 
&quot;It&apos;s just a few weeks into the launch of &apos;Elena of Avalor&apos; and we are already seeing what an impact and connection she is making with kids and families,&quot; Nancy Kanter, executive vice president and general manager of Disney Junior Worldwide, said in a statement. 
The series, which incorporates elements of Latin cultures and folklore, added to Disney&apos;s once whites-only princess universe. That has gradually expanded to include Asian, African-American, Native American and Middle Eastern royals in screen projects.
