BOSTON (AP) — Alex Rodriguez got the raucous booing he expected and the victory his team needed. 
Rodriguez drove in a run with a bases-loaded dribbler, capping a three-run rally in the eighth inning that lifted the New York Yankees over the Red Sox 4-2 on Thursday night and sent New York&apos;s polarizing designated hitter out of Boston with one last victory. 
&quot;It was a lot of fun to be out there,&quot; Rodriguez said after his only start in the series. &quot;Kind of a funny hit at the end. Not how I pictured it when I woke up this morning, but definitely I&apos;m glad that run came in and we won the game.&quot;

Rodriguez is set to play his final game for New York on Friday night at Yankee Stadium against Tampa Bay. The slumping 41-year-old will then be released and become an adviser and instructor for the team. 
Rodriguez was 0 for 4 and loudly jeered throughout the game, which turned in the Yankees&apos; favor on a crucial fielding mistake that allowed them to overcome a 2-1 deficit and take two out of three in the series. 
Rodriguez lined out, popped out and struck out before his tapper in front of the plate in the eighth rolled maybe 10 feet — far enough for Brett Gardner to score from third and put New York up 4-2. 
&quot;That&apos;s how I&apos;m going to remember it — the RBI,&quot; Rodriguez said. &quot;I&apos;m not going to tell anyone how it came.&quot; 
Dellin Betances earned his third save, striking out Dustin Pedroia and Xander Bogaerts with runners at the corners to end it. 
In Chicago, Anthony Rizzo drew a bases-loaded walk from Zach Duke with two outs in the 11th inning as the Chicago Cubs beat St. Louis 4-3 for their 10th consecutive victory. 
Pinch-hitters Willson Contreras and Jorge Soler led off with singles against Duke (2-1) and Dexter Fowler walked to load the bases with one out. Kris Bryant struck out before Rizzo took a 3-1 pitch inside to give the Cubs their longest winning streak since 12 straight in 2001. 
Mike Montgomery (4-5) allowed a single and two walks to load the bases in the 11th before striking out Matt Carpenter. He won for the first time for Chicago since being acquired from Seattle last month. 
The Cardinals fell 13 games behind Chicago in the NL Central and lost Matt Holliday in the 10th after he was hit on the right hand by Mike Montgomery&apos;s 94 mph fastball. 
In Oakland, Mark Trumbo hit a grand slam for his major league-leading 32nd homer and drove in five runs to help Baltimore beat the Athletics 9-6. 
The Orioles had been shut out for 17 straight innings and lost their lead in the AL East following three consecutive one-run losses in the series before Trumbo sparked them. 
The All-Star slugger hit an RBI single in a three-run fourth, then connected the next inning for his third career grand slam. 
Chris Tillman (15-4) allowed two runs over seven innings for his first victory since July 21. He&apos;s Baltimore&apos;s first 15-game winner since Bud Norris and Wei-Yin Chen in 2014. 
Zach Britton retired three batters for his AL-leading 35th save of the season and his 37th consecutive dating to last season. The A&apos;s loaded the bases in the ninth after a replay overturn before Britton got Danny Valencia to ground out to end it. Andrew Triggs (0-1) was the loser. 
In other games, last-place Arizona upset the Mets 9-0 in New York, Kansas City edged past the visiting Chicago White Sox 2-1, Houston easily swept a double-header in Minneapolis, 15-7 and 10-2, Colorado won 12-9 at Texas to end the AL West leaders&apos; win streak at five games, Cleveland beat the visiting Los Angeles Angels 14-4, Pittsburgh won 4-0 at home to San Diego, and Milwaukee beat the visiting Atlanta 11-3.
