Lo: 72° F 40 arrested in child-sex sting in Georgia Since the beginning of the year, the task force has been able to catch a total of 52 people Elizabeth Rawlins Published: August 11, 2016, 7:45 pm Updated: Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) 
(CNN) – The multitude of arrests surprised Effingham County’s sheriff where 40-men are facing charges in a child-sex sting in Georgia. 
At a news conference Thursday, Sheriff Jimmy McDuffie says this was the first year they decided to do sting during the summer months while children were home from school. 
While the internet crimes against children task force has been in place for several years, this was the first time agents wanted to pursue a sting operation that was in line with students being out of school. 
The sheriff says the results were shocking. Prior to this operation, the task force had only caught 12 people but in just the last 10 weeks they caught almost four times that number. 
Sheriff Jimmy McDuffie, Effingham County said, “I had no idea the magnitude that it is on that internet. I had no clue but every one of them that we can get off the street is a potential saving for a child that we don’t have to worry about.” 
Since the beginning of the year, the task force has been able to catch a total of 52 people. Officials expect that number to grow before the end of the year. Share this:
