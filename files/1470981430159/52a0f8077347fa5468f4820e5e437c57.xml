CHICOPEE, Mass. (Mass Appeal) – In this edition of Pet of the Week, we were introduced to Smokey, an 11-year-old female Domestic Shorthair Mix cat. Lee Chambers, Manager of Marketing and Communication for Dakin Humane Society, and Alanna Regan, Dakin’s Feline Success Coordinator, told us more about Smokey, and other events going on a Dakin. 
Background 
Meet lovely Smokey! She’s a beautiful and mature kitty with a quiet side who wants to find a person or family to love. She came to Dakin because her person had health problems and couldn’t care for her. She’d be a perfect companion for a senior, because her person was an elderly gentleman and she loved having him as her pal. Smokey has kidney issues, and a Dakin adoption counselor can tell you more about that. She has always been an indoor kitty and has also lived with a small dog and another cat. Come meet this charming girl at Dakin in Springfield.

News/Other Events 
Special Agents Needed to Save Lives! 
Our Special Agents Program is a way for you to help keep cats and kittens out of cages and in a home environment! It’s easy and fun! Plus … we will give you all of the tools you need AND a cool t-shirt! As a Dakin Special Agent, you will act as a cat or kitten’s foster parent and adoption agent; they will go from your home, to their new home! Dakin Special Agents will provide them with food, litter, shelter and of course … snuggles! As the proud foster parent of adorable cats and kittens, bragging is also required. Show them off to your friends, family and Facebook audience and help find them the home of their dreams! Doing this will free up room on our adoption floor, which keeps animals happier, healthier, and more relaxed and generates more adoptions. Visit our website at dakinhumane.org to find out how to get started! 
Super Small Saturday! – Saturday, August 13 at Dakin Humane Society (both locations) 
This Saturday we will be reducing the adoption fees for small animals (non-cat and non-dog adoptees including rabbits, guinea pigs, birds, ferrets, hamsters, rats and mice … whoever’s available) by 50%. Don’t miss this chance to let these little charmers join your family! Hours in Springfield are 12:30pm-5:30pm, and Leverett is 12:30pm-4:30pm. See who we’ve got available by visiting our web site: https://www.dakinhumane.org/adopt-a-pet-full.html#!/
