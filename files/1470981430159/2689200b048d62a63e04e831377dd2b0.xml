Workrite Uniform Company Announces Launch of Hi-Vis FR Clothing Line 

Workrite Uniform Company, a flame-resistant (FR) clothing manufacturer, announces the launch of its new line of high-visibility “Hi-Vis” FR workwear. The line offers workers protection against thermal hazards along with improved visibility — even when the light is low or the conditions are hazardous. 
The Hi-Vis FR line includes a work shirt and vest from Workrite Uniform’s Dickies® FR brand made from Westex UltraSoft® fabric. Additionally, the Hi-Vis FR line has two garments from the company’s Workrite® FR brand –– a long-sleeved knit T-shirt made from Tecasafe® Plus Knit and a mesh vest made from GlenGuard® fabric. The workwear featured in this Hi-Vis FR line, with the exception of the mesh vest, is also built to withstand industrial laundering (IL). Each garment features solid or segmented two-inch 3M™ reflective silver tape for improved visibility and is UL certified to the NFPA 2112 Standard on Flame-Resistant Garments for Protection of Industrial Personnel Against Flash Fire. 
“At Workrite Uniform, protecting workers against safety hazards without sacrificing comfort or hindering job performance is our top priority,” said Workrite Uniform’s vice president of marketing and merchandising, Lew White. “Through this new Hi-Vis FR line, we are able to offer reliable, high-quality workwear that not only addresses the dangerous conditions caused by poor visibility, but also provides durable, functional and long-lasting flame-resistant protection.” 
High-visibility safety apparel (HVSA) is required for workers in a variety of occupations, many of which also require the use of FR clothing. Workrite Uniform’s “Hi-Vis” FR workwear is beneficial for contractual rental programs that document rentals and comply with state and federal safety regulations. To ensure the appropriate level of protection for each worker, the ANSI/ISEA 107-2015 Standard for High-Visibility Safety Apparel and Accessories specifies the levels of HVSA protection needed in various conditions, and details the performance requirements for workwear in each category. Workrite Uniform’s Hi-Vis line features workwear that meets requirements for ANSI/ISEA 107-2015 Class 2, Type R garments. The Workrite FR Hi-Vis Knit T-shirt surpasses that requirement, meeting the ANSI/ISEA 107-2015 Class 3 requirements. 
The Workrite Uniform Hi-Vis FR line, featuring Dickies FR and Workrite FR garments, is available through industrial distributors and qualified resellers. For more information or to learn more about Workrite Uniform’s brands and products, visit: www.workrite.com .
