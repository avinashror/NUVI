The Seattle Seahawks and Texas A&amp;M have negotiated another five-year contract on the use of &quot;12th Man.&quot; 
Under the new agreement , the Seahawks will continue to pay an annual royalty fee to use the popular phrase for the NFL team&apos;s fans, in limited capacity. 
The Seahawks will no longer use the term &quot;12th Man&quot; on social media, and the phrase won&apos;t be displayed in the &quot;Ring of Honor&quot; at CenturyLink Field. However, the Seahawks can continue to use &quot;12th Man&quot; on their website, for season tickets and in limited marketing campaigns to fans in the Northwest. 
In 2006, the Seahawks and A&amp;M came to an agreement where the Seahawks made a $100,000 one-time payment and $5,000 annual fee to use the &quot;12th Man&quot; in certain promotions. They renewed that agreement in 2011. A&amp;M says the team is now shifting their branding from &quot;12th Man&quot; to &quot;12&quot; or &quot;12s&quot; and will only use &quot;12th Man&quot; for &quot;incidental use.&quot; 
Texas A&amp;M has held the trademark for the &quot;12th Man&quot; since 1990. The phrase originates from the story of E. King Gill , the school&apos;s original &quot;12th Man.&quot; Gill was the Aggies&apos; backup running back in 1921 and quit the team to focus on basketball. During the 1922 New Year&apos;s Day bowl, the Aggies were ravaged by injuries in the game&apos;s first half. Gill, who was watching in the stands, was asked by the coach to stand by in case they ran out of players. Gill suited up, but it turned out he wasn&apos;t needed. 
The name has been traditionally used since for the team&apos;s football fans, ready to take the field when called on.
