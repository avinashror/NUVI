PINELLAS PARK, Fla. -- Protecting yourself on four wheels. 
On Wednesday, a man was killed during a road rage incident . The shooter claims he was just protecting himself. 
Michael Peros with Privacy Electronics in Pinellas Park says having your vehicle equipped with a personal dash cam, could help you prove what really happened. 
“We have a lot of demand for it because a lot of people are concerned with mobile security,” says Peros. 
And not only during a car accident—what about a confrontation with a law enforcement officer and your story was different than theirs? 
10Investigates uncovered that here in the Bay Area , dashcams are on a small percentage of police cruisers. 
“We have cameras that do front and back recording,” says Peros. 
Personal dash cams weren’t that popular until last year and now they are more affordable than ever, making them a cost effective way to prove what happens behind the wheel. 
“You can probably pick up a system for less than $50,” says Peros. 
And it might just land you a discount on your car insurance. We checked with several companies and while they don’t offer one right now for dashcams, they may down the road.
