SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (WWLP) – Alex Scafuri says that his life has become more difficult in an immeasurable number of ways since he was struck by a car more than a year ago, paralyzing him from the waist down. 
Hit-and-run driver sentenced to prison 
Speaking at Hampden Superior Court during a hearing in which hit-and-run driver Jomaris Colon changed her plea to guilty, Scafuri said that everyday tasks such as getting dressed, washing, and going to the bathroom are impossible without assistance. He also cannot visit his girlfriend or his best friend’s house, because he is unable to get up the stairs. But it is the way that things could have been that trouble him the most. 
“The things that cause me the most pain are knowing that I cannot follow my dream of serving my country in the Navy, or propose to my future wife on one knee, or stand to dance and kiss my wife on the day of our wedding,” Scafuri said. 
His father, Chris Scafuri, also spoke to explain how the whole family has suffered as a result of the crash. He spent eight weeks in Atlanta with his son as he went through intensive rehabilitation, and though Alex is now home, he said that it pains him having to see his son unable to care for himself. Though as with Alex, what is most difficult for him is knowing that so many things his son could have experienced are now impossible. 
“One of the toughest things for me to live with is knowing that my son will never be able to make me a grandparent, or that I didn’t take that last chance to throw a ball with him, or even play video games with him. That is something I’ll never get back,” Chris Scafuri said. 
“It pains me to hear my youngest son ask his older brother if they can do things when Alex is finally able to walk again.” 
Colon was sentenced to three and a half to four years in prison for causing the crash that injured Scafuri.
