Cowra Open begins the season for region&apos;s golfers PETE GUTHRIE 12 Aug 2016, 2:32 p.m. Can Mick Curtale return to the sort of form that netted him the 2013 Cowra Open crown 
Cowra golfer Mick Curtale may be among the top contenders for this Sunday’s 2016 Cowra Open, but the left-hander isn’t placing any pressure on himself. CONTENDER: Mick Curtale will back himself to claim the season&apos;s first open. 
Curtale won a playoff hole in 2013 to claim the Cowra Open, a triumph he says came as a shock to himself and his competitors. 
Ahead of this year’s edition, Curtale’s in a similar position with the distance hitter claiming he has no exceptions of lifting the title a second time. 
“I’ve been playing most weekend’s but going a bit ordinary, struggling to break 80 so I have no expectations,” Curtale said. 
“I think that was a bit out of the blue [the 2013 Open win], I wasn’t expected to win it. I think a few blokes had a bad day and I got lucky.” TAP IT IN: Duntryleague gun Andy Campbell is a shot at Cowra. 
“I’m going to go out on Sunday and enjoy the Open on my home course.” 
Curtale is placing an emphasis on a consistent short game in order to consolidate his giant tee shots. Latest News
