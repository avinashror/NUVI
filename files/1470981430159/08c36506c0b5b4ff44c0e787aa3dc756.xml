DENVER BUSINESS JOURNAL - Carl Miller, who followed a newspaper career with a long stint in the insurance industry, has died at age 77. 
Miller died Friday of an apparent heart attack, friend and former colleague Carol Green said. 
Miller was the longtime regional director of government relations for Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Colorado, overseeing its lobbying operation. He started with the insurer in 1990. 
In the mid &apos;90s, Miller worked with Colorado legislators to craft legislation that ultimately allowed the nonprofit insurer to become a for-profit company, creating a charitable foundation from the proceeds of its sale to Anthem Inc. in 1999. Anthem later merged with WellPoint Inc., a one-time rival in the bidding for Blue Cross. The company today is called Anthem Inc. 
He announced he was leaving the company in late 2007 after 17 years. At the time, John Martie, then president of Anthem Blue Cross, called Miller &quot;a brilliant political strategist, analyst and pundit&quot; and a source of “fascinating historical Denver lore.&quot;
