MaxLite Launches Acrylic Pendant for High Bay Lighting Applications 

MaxLite introduces the LED Acrylic High Bay Pendant as high output lighting with exceptional efficacy and architectural appeal for large-scale commercial interiors. 
Available in outputs ranging from 11,000 to 22,000 lumens, the Acrylic High Bay Pendant achieves market-leading efficacy of 140 lumens per watt. The pendant’s cutting-edge LED optics and clear, 16” acrylic reflector distribute light with perfect uniformity and minimal glare, making the luminaire an ideal retrofit for retail spaces, auto showrooms, gymnasiums, warehouses and light industrial environments. A direct replacement for 200-watt to 600-watt metal halide fixtures, the MaxLite Acrylic High Bay Pendant has earned DesignLights Consortium (DLC) Premium status and qualifies for rebates from nationwide utility programs. 
“The Acrylic High Bay Pendant delivers more lumens per dollar than competitive products and provides a quick path to ROI, providing tremendous value for customers with new or retrofit projects,” said Product Manager Ramesh Raghavan. “The pendant’s clean design, smooth output and durability make upgrading to LED a seamless choice for retail and recreation facilities looking to reduce energy costs and improve the quality of light.” 
The MaxLite LED Acrylic High Bay Pendant consumes 70 percent less energy than conventional high bay fixtures and performs much longer, with an L70 rated life of 100,000 hours. Rated for use in damp locations, the pendant is engineered to operate in a wide ambient temperature range of minus four degrees to 122 degrees Fahrenheit. The pendant luminaire is dimmable using 0-10V controls and may be customized with optional battery back-up and motion sensors.
