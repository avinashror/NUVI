Croatia downs Brazil to move to 2-1 in Rio Croatia downs Brazil to move to 2-1 in Rio NBC Olympics.com Published: Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) 
Brazil continues their run of furious fourth quarters, but Croatia managed to hold off the host nation to improve to 2-1 at the Rio Olympics. 
For the third straight game, Brazil was involved in frenetic fourth quarter that came down to the final minute. But, unlike their win over Spain, Brazil came up short against Croatia. 
Bojan Bogdanovic was deadly for the Croatians, scoring 33 points on 10-of-16 shooting, including three daggers from beyond the arc. 
The win improves Croatia to 2-1 in Group B and puts them in a good position to move on to the knockout round. Share this:
