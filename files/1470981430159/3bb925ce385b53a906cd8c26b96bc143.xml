RIO DE JANEIRO - Brazil’s gymnastics sweetheart Jade Barbosa suffered a heartbreaking exit from the women’s all-around final, leaving the competition in a wheelchair after a painful fall during the floor exercise. 
Barbosa, who was not expected to challenge for a medal, landed awkwardly on her knees during her first tumbling pass in Thursday’s second rotation. While wincing in pain, she gamely tried to continue. 
However, on her second pass she made another troubled landing, appearing to damage her left ankle, and immediately stopped, a look of distress on her face. 
Worried team officials rushed to her aid as she was helped into a wheelchair and pushed backstage, while the sympathetic crowd struck up a rousing chant of “Bra-zil.” Loading...
