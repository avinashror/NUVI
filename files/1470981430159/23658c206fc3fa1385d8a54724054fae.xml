Bengaluru, Aug 11 () Infosys Foundation has decided to give at least Rs 10 crore to the families of 800 soldiers who have sacrificed their lives in the defence of the country. 
Announcing this, foundation chairperson Sudha Murthy said, “There are many soldiers who have lost their lives not only at the front, but in naxal attacks. I have a list of 800 people.” 
However, money alone is not enough and people should show affection and support to the suffering families of the martyred soldiers, Murthy said. 
“Money alone is not sufficient. We should show affection and say we are with you. These are all basic elements of a human being and I really feel sad about it. But how much I can do…little in my capacity I always like to do,” she said. 
Murthy also said she feels sad about the “insensitivity” of city civic body Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike marking a portion of the martyred NSG Commando Niranjan Kumar’s house for demolition here. 
“People have become so insensitive, what can I say?. It saddens me,” she told reporters on the sidelines of the launch of Robotic Surgery Training Programme by Narayana Health. 
As part of the ongoing drive against encroachment of stormwater drains, the house of late Lt Col Nirajan Kumar also came under BBMP’s demolition list after officials marked one of the three pillars of the building at Doddabommsandra near Vidyaranyapura. 
However, Kumar’s father Shivarajan and his family have sought time from BBMP to make their own arrangements to remove the marked pillars since they are worried about BBMP officials officials using earthmovers to pull down the structure as it may cause considerable damage to the house itself. 
Kumar, a bomb expert with NSG, had sacrificed his life during the terror attack on Pathankot airbase in January this year. 
He was killed while sanitising a terrorist’s booby-trapped body.
