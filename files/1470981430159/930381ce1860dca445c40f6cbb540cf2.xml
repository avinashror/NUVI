&quot;We planted them just three months ago,&quot; Dalziell said. 
&quot;They were already a metre tall and were looking really good. 
&quot;There&apos;s a few I can trim back and they might grow again but most of them are wrecked.&quot; 
Dalziell said he brought the trees off a friend who has a nursery, who was also upset about the damage. 
He said he spoke to his neighbour who said he heard a car pull in to the street about 9.30pm on Thursday. 
Other than that, the street was quiet, Dalziell said. 
&quot;These guys would have had to jump my fence to get to them, so why do it?&quot; he said. 
&quot;I don&apos;t have any enemies, we&apos;ve only been here for 18 months so I don&apos;t know who would want to do something like this. 
&quot;It&apos;s an unbelievable task and you can&apos;t see them from the road.&quot; 
The incident has prompted neighbours to start up a watch group. 
&quot;It&apos;s a great area so it would be good for us to stick together and keep an eye out for each other.&quot; 
Dalziell said he was unsure whether insurance would replace the trees. 
The incident comes on the back of a petition calling for more police officers in the town. 
In a previous story, Cambridge Community Board Member Philip Coles said the town is seen as a safe place &quot;but that is changing&quot;. 
&quot;As a community board we have spoken about the recent increase in crime since the decision about 18 months ago was made by police to cover Cambridge remotely from Hamilton and Te Awamutu,&quot; Coles said. 
&quot;The amount of burglaries has become an issue and is affecting businesses and if its allowed to continue it may have a detrimental impact on the future of the town as it looks to attract more business and residents.&quot; 
Inspector Greg Nicholls of the Hamilton District Command Centre said police were investigating the vandalism at the Peak Rd property. 
Anyone with information can call Cambridge Police on 07 827 5531 or Crimestoppers if you wish to be anonymous, on 0800 555 111 or email khdt22@police.govt.nz
