Woman facing charges in deadly crash in Shelton Posted: A woman was killed in a Shelton crash on May 6 (WFSB) SHELTON, CT (WFSB) - 
Shelton police said the investigation showed that Samantha Monaco, a driver in another car, was under the influence and was on her cell phone at the time of the crash. 
Monaco reportedly crossed over into a southbound lane of traffic, leading to a head on collision. 
She was charged with second-degree manslaughter with a motor vehicle, operating a motor vehicle under the influence, using a cell phone while operating a motor vehicle, and failure to drive right. 
Monaco was released on a $25,000 bond and is expected to appear in court on Aug. 25.
