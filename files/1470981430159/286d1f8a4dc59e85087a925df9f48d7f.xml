RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) -- A Chinese swimmer has tested positive for banned substances at the Rio Olympics, becoming the first competitor in the sport to fail a test at the games.
The Chinese Swimming Association said Chen Xinyi tested positive for the substance without providing specifics. Xinhua, the official state news agency, reported the story early Friday.
The 18-year-old Chen finished fourth in the women&amp;apos;s 100-meter butterfly Sunday, missing a bronze medal by nine-hundredths of a second. She was also scheduled to compete in the 50 freestyle beginning Friday.
There were no immediate details on the positive test, which comes as doping has been a major storyline in the Rio Games.
Seven Russian swimmers being allowed to compete in Rio after initially being banned following allegations of a huge, state-sponsored doping operation in their homeland. That decision sparked vocal complaints from several swimmers, most notably American Lilly King.
No statement about Chen&amp;apos;s reported test was posted to the website of the Chinese Swimming Association, and calls to its offices rang unanswered on Friday.
Chen&amp;apos;s teammate Wang Shun declined to comment after he won bronze in Thursday&amp;apos;s 200-meter individual medley.
&quot;This situation, I don&amp;apos;t know the details. I&amp;apos;m not aware of it, so unfortunately I can&amp;apos;t answer your question,&quot; Wang said.
Li Keke, a spokeswoman for China&amp;apos;s national anti-doping agency, said she had no additional information.
&quot;We have noticed media reports about the case. So far the anti-doping agency has yet to receive any official confirmation,&quot; Li told The Associated Press.
&quot;This reported test should be generated by the organizer. The Olympic committee and FINA should know about it. At present, we will continue to monitor,&quot; Li said.
FINA, the international governing body of swimming, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
