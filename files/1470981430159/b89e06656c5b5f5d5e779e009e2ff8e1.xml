Lexington, SC (WLTX) - Lexington County Coroner Margaret Fisher says initial autopsy results are inconclusive for the River Bluff High School football player who died after collapsing at practice. 
Fisher said Thursday night that the autopsy was performed on 14-year-old Lewis Simpkins earlier in the day, but could not immediately identify a cause of death. 
&quot;We are awaiting the test results of several studies that should take several more days to complete,&quot; Fisher said. &quot;We want to be as thorough as possible in our investigation.&quot; 
Around 7 p.m. Wednesday, Simpkins went down during drills at one of the fields at River Bluff High School. He was taken by ambulance to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead. 
Lexington County Coroner Margaret Fisher told News19 the teen had no prior medical problems that his family was aware of. 
At River Bluff Thursday, a memorial was held at the cafeteria for friends, family, and teammates of Simpkins. Counselors were on hand to help grieving students and staff.
