One killed in N.C. 410, Old Lumberton Road wreck Thursday filed under News by Les High reported 11 hours ago 
One person was killed today (Thursday) when she was hit by an 18-wheeler at Old Lumberton Road and N.C. 410 north of Chadbourn. 
The small car, which was eastbound on Old Lumberton Road, pulled in front of the southbound truck, which struck the car on the driver’s side. The driver of the car, which was destroyed, was ejected. 
The impact tossed the car a considerable distance down N.C. 410 and across a ditch. The driver was declared dead at the scene. 
The wreck happened about 1:30 p.m. 
Cat Radcliff, who came upon the wreck soon after it happened, said that “there have been so many wrecks here. This is so tragic. When I saw her in the ditch, I knew she was gone. We swept the pieces of the car off the road so no one else would get hurt. You never know how much time you have.” 
Chadbourn Rescue and Evergreen and Klondyke fire departments responded. 
The driver of the truck, which was pulling a box-type trailer, was shaken up but not hurt. The truck had a Wayne E. Bailey Produce insignia on the door. Witnesses said the driver tried to avoid the collision. 
The car driver’s name is being withheld pending notification of next of kin. Digital Edition
