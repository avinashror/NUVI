Bill to Eliminate Daylight Saving Time in Calif. Advances Posted on August 11, 2016 FRESNO, Calif. (KMJ) — A proposal to eliminate daylight saving time in the Golden State has cleared the Senate Appropriations Committee. http://www.kmjnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/461/2016/08/AA-DAYLIGHT-SAVING-TIME-8-11-16.mp3 
DLS time in California was established in 1949, as a means of conserving energy, and allowing for more daytime activities. 
However, opponents have cited research, showing that heart attacks, traffic accidents, and deaths increase, following a time change. 
If the bill to do away with it is approved and signed by Gov. Jerry Brown voters would get to weigh in, on the 2018 ballot.
