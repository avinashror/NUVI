They&apos;re the best of friends, they&apos;re the best of rivals. 
The Rio Olympics will mark the final showdown, so they say, between Michael Phelps and Ryan Lochte in the 200-meter individual medley. 
Phelps might be considered the greatest Olympian of all time, but Lochte is right up there with him. 
According to NBC Olympics , the two own 93 Olympic and world championship medals between them and they have combined for the last five world record progressions and all of the reported top 10 all-time performances. 
Phelps won his 21st career Olympic gold medal on Tuesday night in the 4x200m freestyle relay. He has long been the most decorated Olympian. But by also winning gold, Lochte became the second most-decorated male swimmer. 
Together they&apos;ve been a powerhouse, winning multiple gold medals as relay teammates and currently holding the Olympic record for the 4x200m freestyle relay. But outside of the relays, their rivalry has been one for the ages -- arguably one of the best in sports history. 
Phelps and Lochte have been the top two on the podium in nearly every 200m IM Olympics and World Championship since 2003. They were the one-two punch again during the 2016 Olympic Trials in Omaha, Nebraska. 
While Phelps has never lost the 200 IM Olympic race dating back to Athens 2004, Lochte has won every World Championship since 2009 -- although it should be noted, in that time Phelps only swam once (2011) at the Worlds. 
The world record belongs to Lochte, which he set in 2011. 
Let&apos;s dive (pun intended) deeper into the tale of the tape: 
Age 
Lochte: 32 
Olympic debut 
Phelps: Sydney 2000, became the youngest male to make a U.S. Olympic swim team in 68 years. 
Lochte: Athens 2004, qualified after finishing second to Phelps in the 200m IM at the Olympic Trials. 
Head-to-head match-up wins (major national and international competition) 
Phelps: 13
