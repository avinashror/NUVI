MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Major league batting leader Jose Altuve got four hits, drove in three runs and scored three, sending the Houston Astros past the Minnesota Twins 15-7 Thursday in the first game of a split doubleheader. 
The doubleheader was caused by a rainout Wednesday night in a game Minnesota led 5-0 in the third inning. 
Altuve has eight hits in his last nine at-bats, raising his average to .366. He is hitting .438 on the road. 
Carlos Correa homered as Houston got a season-high 19 hits and won for just the fifth time in 16 games. Marwin Gonzalez tied a career high with four hits. 
Kennys Vargas homered from each side of the plate for Minnesota. 
Twins shortstop Eduardo Escobar relieved Taylor Rogers in a three-run ninth inning and, after giving up a single, recorded three straight outs.. 
Doug Fister (11-7) threw seven-plus innings, allowing eight hits and five earned runs. 
Jose Berrios (2-3) was ineffective for the third straight start, lasting just two innings and giving up six runs and eight hits. Since his Aug. 1 recall from Triple-A, he&apos;s allowed 12 earned runs in 13 innings. 
In seven starts this season, the righty has a 9.32 ERA over 28 innings, permitting 39 hits and 14 walks. 
Altuve hit an RBI double off the wall in right-center in the first inning and dashed for third base on the throw home. Catcher Juan Centeno&apos;s throw to third sailed down the left-field line, allowing Altuve to trot home. 
Four straight hits with two outs in the second made it 6-0. George Springer hit a two-run double, Alex Bregman had an RBI double and Altuve singled home a run. 
Correa hit his 17th homer, a three-run drive off Buddy Boshers as part of a six-run fifth inning. 
Vargas snapped an 0-for-12 skid with a second-inning home run. He became the fourth player in team history to homer as both a left- and right-handed hitter in the same game with a two-run shot in the eighth off Tony Sipp. 
DOUBLING UP 
This was Houston&apos;s 255th all-time doubleheader, but first against an American League team. The Astros were in the National League from 1962-2012. 
TRAINER&apos;S ROOM 
Twins: RHP Trevor May, put on the disabled list Wednesday with a lower back strain, was scheduled to see a specialist. 
UP NEXT 
Houston&apos;s Chris Devenski (0-4, 2.51) and Minnesota&apos;s Tommy Milone (3-3, 5.23) will each come out of the bullpen to start the nightcap.
