JUBILANT staff at Olympic star Max Whitlock’s training base have told of their incredible pride after he bagged bronze in Rio - and they are hoping for more to come. 
The hugely-talented gymnast, 23, from Basildon , made history on Wednesday when he became the first British gymnast to win a medal in the all-round event for 108 years. 
Max trains at the Sporting Village, Cranes Farm Road, Basildon with the South Essex Gymnastic Club - and he coaches at the club. 
Matt Jackson, 35, assistant director of gymnastic coaching and head men’s gymnastic coach at the club said he was on the edge of his seat watching the event. 
He added: “I was watching Max in Rio with my family and when it came down to the final movement it was a bit nerve-wracking. 
“On the night his technique was great and it was very tidy. 
“Max has been with us since he was aged 11 and we have really seen him grow and it’s been fantastic to see him develop into the fantastic sportsman he is today. 
“We now have more than 3,000 members here and since the increase in interest we have had to develop and create new groups and employ new staff. 
“Due to popular demand we now have a waiting lists that is 18 months for new starters. When Max took part in the 2012 London Olympics we held a special home coming party for him at the Sporting Village. 
“It was a great event.” 
Roy Short, 66, chairman of South Essex Gymnastic Club, says he feels as though Max is his grandson and he feels like a proud family member. 
He added: “Max sets his mind on success and he puts his all into his sport.” 
After Max’s success, his coach Scott Hann became embroiled in a social media spat with TV host Piers Morgan, who suggested celebrating silver and bronze medals was a “losing mentality” and competitors should only be satisfied with gold. 
Mr Hann responded: “We have been working six days and 30 hours per week. We’ll take bronze.”
