“There is a myth out there that he’ll stick it to the rich and powerful because, somehow, at heart, he’s really on the side of the little guy,” 68-year-old Clinton said. “Don’t believe it,” Clinton said at an election rally in the city of Detroit which is considered as the auto capital of the world. 
Clinton was referring to the tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations that Trump presented in a speech in Detroit on Monday, saying he “wants to give trillions in tax breaks to people like himself,” which would lead to broad cuts in spending on education, health care and environmental protection.

“Not when he pledges to rip up basic rules that hold corporations accountable.
