West Ham have confirmed the signing of 22-year-old Jonathan Calleri . 
The Argentinian striker joins the Hammers on a season-long loan, arriving from Uruguayan side Maldonado . 
Slaven Bilic told whufc.com: &quot;Unfortunately for him, but good for us, Argentina were knocked out of the Olympics this week, so he should be here with us pretty soon, depending on the work permit. 
&quot;We did the deal a little while ago, and he is a top striker. You need a squad, of course, but it is all about the balance. I think we have a good balance.&quot; 
Calleri made three appearances for the Argentina Olympic team, scoring one against Algeria. 
He spent the first half of this year on loan with Sao Paulo , scoring nine goals in 12 Copa Libertadores matches. BREAKING: The Hammers have agreed a loan move for Argentinean striker @Jocalleri https://t.co/5eAjxX3K4B #WHUFC pic.twitter.com/FuVcZkhVgy
