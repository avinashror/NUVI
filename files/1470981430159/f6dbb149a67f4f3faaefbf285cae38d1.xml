August 11th Baseball Texas Daily, but at Night, the Late Version! Levi Weaver , WFAA 12:09 AM. CDT August 12, 2016 The runner was safe by about an inch, but don&apos;t let that ruin it: this was a beautiful play. Tim Heitman-USA TODAY Sports Date: Thursday, August 11th, 2016 Rangers Record : (68-48, 1st place, +6.5 games) Opponent: Colorado Rockies Today’s Starters (were) : Chad Bettis (5IP, 9H, 5ER, 3BB, 2K) vs. Lucas Harrell (6IP, 9H, 6ER, 1BB, 8K) Welcome to the first ever “Baseball Texas Daily, but at Night, the Late Version”. With the day game after the night game today, the clubhouse / manager interview time was pretty consolidated. Usually, the Daily is published an hour before first pitch, but today, we didn’t get to the press box til then, and I hadn’t eaten. So here we are: a compromise. I got my eggs and chicken fingers with ranch dressing, and you get a Daily, but at Night, the Late Version. It’s a whole new world! Everything is backwards! I even got a music recommendation from Mitch Moreland. MUSIC RECOMMENDATION I’ve had a few requests to ask Mitch Moreland for a music rec, and I got a chance to ask him today before the game. Without hesitation, he went with “Bury Me in My Boots” by Cadillac Three. There, I did it. ( Spotify , iTunes , Website ) Occasionally these recommendations come from Rangers players, broadcasters, or other people around the team ( here’s a complete list ). If there’s a player or person you’d like Levi to ask for a music recommendation, shoot him an e-mail or a tweet here . BASEBALL STUFF 1. Let’s catch up on the last 36 hours. First, here’s yesterday’s Daily , which is pretty Prince -centric, but there are also a few other things that you might have missed in all the press conference madness. For example: Ryan Rua is in AAA now. 2. With that finished , the Rangers did their comeback thing last night, coming back to win 3. Then today, they did it again, for a bit , b t then the Rockies scored 6 runs off the Rangers’ bullpen and staged a 12-9 comeback of their own . 4. Here is some postgame video that I just plain forgot to put in the game story. Sorry. 5. It wasn’t good for the Rangers, but we got to see a cool bit of History today, when David Dahl, in his 17th MLB game, extended his hitting streak to 17 games. That ties a modern-era MLB record, originally set in 1941 by Chuck Aleno of the Reds. He’ll have a chance to break that record 6. The Back-to-Back home runs by Adrian Beltre and Mitch Moreland today were the 10th time the Rangers have gone back-to-back this season, but the first time they’ve done it at home since last August against Seattle, when Moreland, Mike Napoli, and Elvis Andrus did it in Derek Holland’s return from the DL. 7. Speaking of Derek Holland, we talked to him today about his return. “I felt great - everything went where it needed to go. I started off a little bit slow, location-wise, everything was up, but I just gotta adjust, take care of what I need to do, but overall, I felt like everything was good. I was very happy with it.” Holland threw three innings, then threw 16 additional pitches in the bullpen after, for a total of 77 pitches. His next start will be in Salt Lake City on Tuesday MINOR LEAGUE REPORT AAA - Round Rock won 8-3 on Wednesday, when Joey Gallo hit his 22nd home run of the season, going 3-for-5 with 3 runs and 3 RBI. He also struck out twice. Matt Duffy and Ronald Guzman both went 3-for-4, and Guzman - after a rough start at AAA - has made an adjustment, and has his batting average back up to .250. Wednesday was Derek Holland’s rehab start (which we discussed earlier) He went 3 innings, giving up 4 hits, 1 run, and 1 walk, striking out 2. Round Rock had Thursday off. RECORD: 57-62 AA - After an 8-1 win on Wednesday, Frisco got just 2 hits in a 5-1 loss on Thursday. One of the hits was an Andy Ibanez solo home run. OVERALL RECORD: 56-60 SECOND-HALF RECORD: 18-29 HIGH-A - High Desert scored 3 runs each on Wednesday and Thursday. The first one was enough for a 3-1 win, but the latter was a 4-3 loss (both to San Jose). Luke Tendler and Jairo Beras each got 2 hits. OVERALL RECORD: 69-47 SECOND-HALF RECORD: 26-20 LOW-A - Hickory has a losing streak. They lost 8-0 to Augusta on Wednesday, then dropped a 5-3 contest to Rome on Thursday. Joe Palumbo struck out 6 in 5 innings, but gave up 4 runs on 7 hits. OVERALL RECORD: 62-54 SECOND HALF RECORD: 24-22 SHORT SEASON-A - 2 runs was enough to win both of the last two games Spokane and Tri-Cities played. Wednesday was a 2-1 loss for the Indians, but Thursday was a 2-0 shutout win. Leody Taveras picked up a couple more hits, and Sal Mendez threw 6⅔ shutout innings. RECORD: 27-25 SECOND HALF RECORD: 8-6 AZ ROOKIE LEAGUE - Jonah McReynolds and Kole Enright each got 4 hits atop the AZL Rookie Rangers’ lineup, and they beat the Royals 5-2 RECORD 15-25
