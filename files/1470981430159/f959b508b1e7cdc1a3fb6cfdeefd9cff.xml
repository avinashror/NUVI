Bill seeks toll-free expressways on holidays Text: Eric Tipan / Photos: Toll Regulatory Board | posted August 12, 2016 07:39 Toll-Free Holiday Act of 2016 filed in House of Representatives 
The upcoming holiday season may just become a tad merrier for motorists rushing home for Noche Buena and even the ones simply trying to escape all the fireworks of New Year’s Eve. 
House Bill 1169 or the ‘Toll-Free Holiday Act of 2016’ aims to make tollway operators give back to motorists in their own little way by implementing a tax holiday on Christmas and New Year’s Eve. 
Rep. Eric Olivarez of the 1 st District of Paranaque City aims to make the various expressways toll-free between the hours of 10PM to 6AM on December 24-25 and also on December 31-January 1. 
“The toll free eves on Christmas and New Year has been a tradition of toll way operators of the Skyway System, South Luzon Expressway and Star Tollway for many years as a way of expressing their gratitude to the motoring patrons and as part of their Corporate Social Responsibility,” said Congressman Olivarez. 
The bill aims to make this unofficial tradition a formal law and implemented on Cavite Expressway (CAVITEX), North Luzon Expressway (NLEX), South Luzon Expressway (SLEX), Muntinlupa-Cavite Expressway (MCX), Skyway, STAR Tollway, Subic-Clark-Tarlac Expressway (SCTEX) and Tarlac-Pangasinan-La Union Expressway (TPLEX) and future expressways that will be under the control and supervision of the Toll Regulatory Board (TRB). 
Should the bill be passed, the TRB will be tasked to draw up the implementing rules and regulations (IRR) and tollway operators may claim the actual cost of the implementation as tax deduction. Related Articles
