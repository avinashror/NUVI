Middletown middle school floods after storm Posted: The halls were flooded at Woodrow Wilson Middle School in Middletown. (Dan Drew) MIDDLETOWN, CT (WFSB) - 
A middle school in Middletown was flooded with water after a storm on Thursday. 
The water flooded through the HVAC system at Woodrow Wilson Middle School, according to Mayor Dan Drew. A cleaning crew was brought in on Thursday night to clear the water from the building. 
Middletown Public Schools resume classes on Sept. 1. 
Drew noted on Facebook that their dispatch center antenna was also struck by lightning. 
&quot;We have crews out making repairs to everything now. The antenna is fine (because they&apos;re designed to withstand direct hits),&quot; Drew posted on social media.
