NEW DELHI: Ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to chair an all-party meeting on Friday to discuss the prevailing situation in Kashmir, political parties are hopeful that a way-out will emerge and peace will return to the Valley, which is on the boil since Hizbul Mujahideen Posterboy Burhan Wani was killed in an encounter on July 8. 
Wani was killed in an encounter by a joint team of the special operations group of the Jammu and Kashmir Police and 19 Rashtriya Rifles at Bumdoora village in Kokernag area of Anantnag district on July 8. 
Stating that we will have to work very hard to save “Hindustan-occupied Kashmir”, Shi Sena’s Sanjau Raut said, “There will be an all-party meeting today, everybody will come, hold discussions and put forward their views. But, the situation in Kashmir is grime, curfew has been imposed for over 30 days, people are defying it and coming out on the streets. Besides, there are attacks on our jawans. 
“The thing is what comes out of the all-party meeting we will have to think about that. It has to be done by the government and security forces. Howsoever you condemn the use of pellet guns, the situation that Pakistan has created there, only our army and security forces have saved Kashmir. You will have to accept it first.” 
“Our people are very wise, they will give their suggestions as well and an all-party delegation will also visit Kashmir, but who will make the people understand. We will have to work very hard to save Hindustan-occupied Kashmir. We will have to understand their mind, reason behind stone pelting and unemployment situation,” Raut added.
