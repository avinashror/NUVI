Daily Caller&apos;s Jamie Weinstein Calls for &apos;Negotiated Surrender to Hillary&apos; Chris Menahan From Breitbart : The Daily Caller&apos;s Senior Writer Jamie Weinstein, a member of the &quot;NeverTrump&quot; faction, has proposed a &quot;negotiated Republican surrender&quot; to Hillary Clinton. The suggested deal rests on the assumption that Clinton is &quot;on a glide path to the White House,&quot; and that Republicans would do best to appease her now. The terms: Republican leaders agree to &quot;rescind&quot; endorsements of Trump in exchange for one Supreme Court seat; rudimentary entitlement reform (read: higher taxes); a &quot;Gang of Eight-style immigration bill&quot;; a federal minimum-wage increase; up-or-down votes on future Supreme Court nominees; and a few national security appointments. There is no room for actual voters in this scheme, which Weinstein envisions as a brokered arrangement between politicians. Weinstein writes: &quot;Ideally, the Republican delegation would include a wide range of respected Republicans and conservatives from both the establishment and anti-establishment, but for it to matter to Hillary, it must also definitely include Republican congressional leaders like House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (and as many other members of Congress as possible) who would actually be in a position of fulfill the commitments of a deal.&quot; Here&apos;s video of Weinstein attacking Chuck Johnson at the RNC: All these phony #NeverTrump &quot;conservatives&quot; went along with everything out of Romney, McCain, and George Bush, yet they hate Donald Trump who is more right-wing than any of them. I wonder if this has anything to do with it: Follow InformationLiberation on Twitter and Facebook . MORE FROM INFORMATIONLIBERATION:
