Patriots strike on offense, defense to beat Saints WCSH 10:31 PM.

(AP) - Jimmy Garoppolo made his preseason debut, spreading the ball around for 168 yards, and Jamie Collins added a 43-yard interception return for a touchdown as the New England Patriots beat the New Orleans Saints 34-22 on Thursday night. Garoppolo played the entire first half as he preps to start the first four games of the regular season in place of Tom Brady, who will be serving a suspension for his involvement in the &quot;Deflategate&quot; case. Brady was not in the building Thursday, excused by the team to attend memorial services for a family member. Saints running back Mark Ingram had an early fumble, but also had two 1-yard touchdown runs in an extended night that saw him play most of the first half. Second-year quarterback Garrett Grayson threw an early interception, but completed a few long passes to finish 10 for 16 for 133 yards. Defensive end Kasim Edebali had two first-quarter sacks. After a slow start, Garoppolo completed several long passes and finished 11 of 18. He converted a fourth-down run. Trey Flowers added a 17-yard fumble recovery for a touchdown in the fourth quarter, scooping up the loose ball created by his sack of Luke McCown.
