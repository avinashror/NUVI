RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Isil Alben hit two free throws with 13.1 seconds left as Turkey held off Belarus 74-71 Thursday in group play to take another step closer to advancing in group play. Belarus (1-3) had several chances at the end. Tatyana Troina missed two jumpers before her final driving layup bounced off the glass, leaving her clasping her hands over her face in anguish. Lindsey Harding’s final desperation heave from outside the arc was also off the mark. Harding finished with 17 points. 
Nevriye Yilmaz scored 26 points for Turkey (2-2), now the fourth team in Group A with at least two wins. Lara Sanders added 22 points and 11 rebounds. Neither team led by more than eight. Belarus last led at 49-48 off a free throw by Harding. Turkey took the lead for good with a 14-6 run, then held on as fans chanted “Belarus” while blowing a horn most of the game. Share this:
