The 19th edition of the three-day Texas Volleyball Invitational, the largest high school volleyball tournament in the country, starts Thursday, with 80 teams competing at 10 different locations. 
Winners in four divisions will be crowned Saturday at Pearland and Dawson. 
The gold division championship game is scheduled to start at 4:45 p.m. Saturday on Court 1 at Pearland. 
The Invitational has growing local competition, with the 48-team Nike Invitational attracting many of Houston&apos;s top teams, including Fort Bend Austin, Oak Ridge, The Woodlands, Cypress Falls and Magnolia. 
But it&apos;s still the No. 1 destination for the state&apos;s elite. The field features the reigning state champs in classes 6A (Hebron), 5A (Dripping Springs) and 4A (Argyle), eight of the top 14 teams in the Texas Girls Coaches Association &apos;s 6A preseason state poll - including No. 5 Austin Westlake and No. 6 Pearland - and the TGCA&apos;s top six 5A teams. Coppell clipped Clear Creek for the gold championship last year. 

Hebron - The reigning 6A state champ is the top-ranked 6A team entering the season. 
New Braunfels Canyon - The 11-time state qualifiers fell to Hebron in last year&apos;s 6A semis. 
Dawson - Almost everyone&apos;s back after falling to state finalist Fort Bend Austin last year. 
George Ranch - The reigning Region III-5A champs are in 6A now. 
Amarillo - The 15-time state qualifiers are on the hunt for another title.
