Media Invitation – Centennial College’s HYPE graduation celebrates tuition-free community learning Canada NewsWire
TORONTO, Aug. 9, 2016
TORONTO , Aug. 9, 2016 /CNW/ - More than 100 young people committed a significant part of their summer to participate in Centennial College’s HYPE program – Helping Youth Pursue Education – a tuition-free learning experience that can open doors to higher education and rewarding careers.
Over the past six weeks the students, aged 17 to 29, took part in six career-oriented courses in business fundamentals, human development, automotive technology, esthetics, introduction to computers and digital media.
The initiative promotes education attainment by reducing barriers to participation for youth living in under-served neighbourhoods primarily in Toronto’s east end. One-third of HYPE graduates go on to pursue full-time studies at college in the fall.
Centennial introduced career counselling sessions to participants this year, and continued to offer help with student loan applications, as well as offer HYPE Works Express – a one-week program designed to increase employment readiness for youth who have to work prior to full-time study, or who may have to work part-time during college. HYPE Works Express will be partially funded by TD Bank Group beginning in 2017.
The HYPE Class of 2016 will be recognized for their achievement at a graduation ceremony on Thursday, August 11 at 1:30 pm . Media representatives are invited to attend the graduation and to speak with participants.
What:
Students will be graduating as part of Centennial’s HYPE program
Date:
Thursday, August 11
Time:
1:30 to 3:30 pm
Location:
Athletic &amp; Wellness Centre, Progress Campus, Centennial College
