Print Close L.A. Avenue to trucks 
I am happy to see recent letters to the editor highlighting the plight of Moorpark residents as it pertains to the travels and travails along Los Angeles Avenue. 
I refer to it as the Big Rig superhighway, and now our friends from Ventura County want to give us even more big trucks to haul sand and gravel. Brilliant! 
I commend Moorpark city government for trying to fight this increase in traffic and for recently widening another strip of L.A. Avenue. Unfortunately this is only putting a Band-Aid on a gaping wound. 
We have seen the lack of foresight from those who planned our city from the beginning and the effects it has had on the retail establishments that have tried to exist along L.A. Avenue. 
Can you imagine how retail centers in Thousand Oaks, Simi Valley and Westlake Village would have fared if they would have been planned and built along a major trucking artery? 
I have tried to suggest in the past that L.A. Avenue should be closed to truck traffic for key periods of time in the morning and afternoon/early evening but no one seems to be listening. 
Add to that the fact that we now have a “red light district” along this major highway that stifles traffic flow most of the time except between the hours of midnight to 6 a.m. 
When I drive down L.A. Ave. starting at Tierra Rejada going east towards the 23/118, I consistently hit red lights 70 to 80 percent of the time. Often the traffic is stopped for one or two cars that are attempting to cross traffic. 
Considering that 70 to 80 percent of the traffic flows east and west on L.A. Avenue, this should not be happening. It should not take almost 10 minutes to go three miles to get to the freeway. Is anyone listening?
