RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Reserve Sandrine Gruda scored 17 points and grabbed 10 rebounds to lead France to a 74-64 victory over host Brazil in women’s basketball on Thursday. 
France (3-1), which had lost control of Group A with an 18-point loss to Australia, missed its first five shots against Brazil (0-4). The Brazilians opened up a seven-point lead, much to the delight of the raucous home crowd that was clapping and chanting to the end. 
But France finally started hitting shots, including a 3-pointer from Amel Bouderra at the end of the first quarter, tying the game at 20. And with the Brazilians missing layups, France took its first lead at 31-29 on a Gruda jumper in the paint, the first of six straight points and took a 35-29 halftime lead. France extended its lead to 14 in the third, and Brazil never got closer than nine the rest of the game. 
Gaelle Skrela scored 18 points for France. Share this:
