Chief takes responsibility for fatal academy shooting Associated Press , KARE 2:28 PM. CDT August 11, 2016 Mary Knowlton CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST 
PUNTA GORDA, Fla. - The Punta Gorda police chief says he is taking full responsibility after one of his officers shot and killed a woman during a police &quot;shoot/don&apos;t shoot&quot; demonstration. 
Chief Tom Lewis said Thursday during a news conference that he is 100 percent accountable. At a citizens&apos; academy meeting on Tuesday night, officer Lee Coel mistakenly shot 73-year-old Mary Knowlton, a Minnesota woman, during the exercise. Immediately after the shooting, the police chief says authorities secured the scene and called the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate. He says it should take that agency between two to four weeks to complete its probe. The officer has been placed on administrative leave. The chief says they are offering counseling to Knowlton&apos;s family as well as police and members of the community who witnessed the shooting. 
Knowlton was a longtime librarian for several school districts in Minnesota, from the 1980s up until a few years ago.
