Photovoltaics program returns to Moorpark College 
ACORN FILE PHOTO The Photovoltaics program will relaunch at Moorpark College this fall. 
Photovoltaics, the process of converting solar power into electricity, is one of the fastest growing fields in the United States. Annual job growth is 20 percent since 2015, representing more than 115,000 new jobs in the U.S. 
The workforce is diverse with 24 percent women, 8 percent veterans, 11 percent Hispanic, 9 percent Asian/Pacific Islanders and 5 percent African American. 
After several searches to find an industry insider who is qualified to lead the program, the college hired Dr. Peter T. Parrish to teach the two lecture and laboratory courses in solar energy and photovoltaic technologies. 
Parrish holds a Ph.D. in solid state physics and is a NABCEP Certified PV Professional. 
The college has three mock roofs for students to practice installation of PV modules and PV systems that can be installed and broken down each term. 
Students enrolled in the program can earn a Proficiency Award in Photovoltaic Technology in one to two semesters by taking four courses, including an optional internship at a solar company. 
Solar companies in Los Angeles and Ventura counties include American Solar Power, PHAT Energy, Vivent, Solar Electrical Systems and Solar City. 
In addition to installation, job opportunities are available for design engineers, sales and marketing, assembling and general office staff in solar panels. 
Registration is open and classes begin Wed., Aug. 17 and Sat., Aug. 20. Evening and weekend classes are available to accommodate working adults. 
For more information, call Parrish at (323) 839-6108 or email or the Moorpark College Sciences and Student Engagement Division at (805) 553-4133 or send an email to .
