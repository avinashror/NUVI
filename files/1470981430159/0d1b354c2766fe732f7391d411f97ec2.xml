Newton: Flowers? For me? You shouldn’t have! 
Newton: * SNIFF * How lovely! 
Pierre: Oh, hey, Newt, what do you have there? 
Newt: What does it look like? 
Pierre: It looks like flowers. Who sent you flowers? 
Newton: Probably a secret admirer. There’s no card. 
Pierre: No card? Then how do you know the flowers are for you? Maybe they’re for me. 
Newton: Because I found them first. My secret admirer is shy. 
Pierre: Fine, you can have them. They don’t smell like they will taste good, anyhow. 
Newton: Ha, they’re all mine now! 
Newton: I really wish I knew who sent you, little flowers. Too bad you can’t talk. If you could you would…. OOPS! 
Newton: My poor flowers! This is sad. But no one saw this happen, so we can blame it on Pierre. The important part is that I get to keep the secret admirer.
