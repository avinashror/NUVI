Markets Today Why Tesla Investors Should Be Worried About the Company&apos;s Rising Cash Needs The market ignored Tesla&apos;s recent large stock sale. Will they be so forgiving over the next 18 months as Tesla&apos;s cash needs increase dramatically? Eric Jackson Aug11,20161:55PMEDT 
Tesla&apos;s ( TSLA ) cash needs and stock dilution have not mattered much to investors to date, but the time is fast approaching when they should. 
In May, the electric carmaker announced that it would raise $2 billion in a stock sale. Of this, $1.4 billion was sold for general corporate purposes by the company and the rest sold by CEO Elon Musk to cover taxes he owed due to exercising stock options recently. 
This type of large sale had been what many Tesla bears had been expecting for some time. The sale seemed to validate their concerns that Tesla won&apos;t be able to fulfill its financial obligations to complete the Gigafactory and produce the new Model 3 car without raising a lot of capital. 
The initial reaction on the day of the announcement a drop in Tesla&apos;s stock of nearly 4% in the after-hours session. Yet, the next day, Tesla&apos;s stock finished higher and it hasn&apos;t been lower since, except for 4 trading days following the announcement of the proposed SolarCity ( SCTY ) acquisition in June. 
In other words, the market has ignored the additional 9.3 million shares in dilution from the stock sale at $215/share, which brings the total Tesla shares outstanding to almost 150 million. 
If not now, then when will Tesla&apos;s cash needs and dilution matter to its stock price? 
The recent 10-Q filed by the company, as well as the one filed Tuesday by SolarCity show a number of concerns investors should have about Tesla&apos;s rising cash obligations. Here are 4: Prev 0 of 4 Next If you liked this article you might like
