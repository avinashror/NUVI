U.S.’ Steve Johnson and Madison Keys could win medals 
The competitions are starting to narrow, and fans can finally see where all the early exits and crazy upsets lead. 
Thursday saw the quarterfinals of the women’s singles and doubles competitions, the third round of men’s singles, the semifinals of men’s doubles and the first round of mixed doubles. (NBC streamed over 20 of the 26 total matches that took place.) 
Germany’s Angelique Kerber has had an incredible 2016, kicking off with a January win against World No. 1 Serena Williams at the Australian Open. Though she lost early in the French Open, the German made it to her second Grand Slam final at Wimbledon, where she lost to Williams. 
She continued this streak during her quarterfinal match against Great Britain’s Johanna Konta today on Centre Court. Kerber all but demolished her opponent, winning 6-1, 6-2. 
With every winning match, Kerber edges closer to becoming the first German woman since Steffi Graff to win an Olympic medal in women’s singles. (Graff won two: gold at the 1988 Seoul Games and silver at the 1992 Barcelona Games.) 
On the men’s side, Argentina’s Juan Martin del Potro continued his incredible comeback following years of wrist surgeries. It took him three sets, but the unseeded Argentine downed Japan’s Taro Daniel 6(4)-7(7), 6-1, 6-2. 
Finally, Venus Williams won her first match at the Rio 2016 Olympics – just not in an expected category. Teaming up with the U.S.’ Rajeev Ram for mixed doubles, the Americans downed the Dutch team of Bertens/Rojer . 
Friday will see just about half the total of Thursday’s matches, including the finals of the men’s doubles competition.
