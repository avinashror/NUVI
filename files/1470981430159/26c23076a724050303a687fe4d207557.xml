Bud Williams kicks off campaign for 11th Hampden District State Rep. Williams said he&apos;ll fight for education, jobs and drug treatment on demand. August 11, 2016, 11:01 pm Updated: Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) 
SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (WWLP) – Long time Springfield City Councilor Bud Williams wants to make the leap from Springfield City Hall to the State House in Boston. 
Williams kicked off his campaign for State Representative for the 11th Hampden District Thursday night. Family and supporters attended Williams’ formal announcement in a State Street pavilion. 
Speaking about himself in third person, Williams said he has a five point plan which includes a new building to replace the century-old Homer Street School, drug treatment on demand, and jobs training. 
“Bud Williams will continue to fight for jobs for folks in the 11th Hampden District. And city jobs for city people,” said Williams, who believes people who work for the city of Springfield should live in the city of Springfield. 
Williams describes himself as a proven leader. “Bud Williams fought to get the senior center in Blunt park. It took 15 years but we finally got it done,” Williams said. 
Williams is running for the seat being vacated by Benjamin Swan, who is not running for re-election. Share this:
