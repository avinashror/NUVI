A 14-month-old infant died after he was reportedly hit by a car driven by his grandfather outside their home at Taman Datul Iman, Bukit Kruang in Kemamam. The victim Ahmad Syawal Anaqi Ahmad Fadzi passed away at the Hospital Kemamam. Kemaman OCPD Supt Mohamad Said Ibrahim said the 59-year-old grandfather was reversing his car into the front porch and did not realise his grandson had crawled out from the main door. He had wanted to move his Perodua Axia which was parked five metres away from the house. “He was shocked to see his grandson bleeding beside his car,” said Mohamad Said. The baby was still alive and was rushed to the hospital before he was pronounced dead three hours later. It is understood that the victim was placed under the care of his grandparents while the parents went to work. The grandmother was inside the house when it happened. The case is being investigated under Section 41 of the Road Transport Act 1987 for causing death by reckless or dangerous driving.
