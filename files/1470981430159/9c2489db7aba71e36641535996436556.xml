2016 Toyota Yaris to get Dual VVT-i, CVT Text: Marcus De Guzman / Photos: Brent Co | posted August 12, 2016 13:36 Toyota Motors Philippines to upgrade Yaris powertrain for 2016 The Toyota Vios won&apos;t be the only model to get a powertrain update for 2016. Toyota Motors Philippines (TMP) recently announced that the Yaris will also be getting the new engines and transmission option. Like the 2016 Vios, the upcoming hatchback will also be getting the new NR-series of engines, along with a continuously variable transmission. The new engines for the 2016 Yaris will come in the form of a 1.3- and 1.5-liter inline-four with Dual VVT-i. Set to replace the NZ-series of motors, the new engines aim to deliver better response and fuel economy. Meanwhile, the 4-speed automatic gearbox will be replaced by a continuously variable transmission (CVT) that comes with a 7-speed manual mode. The 5-speed manual gearbox will still be available when it arrives. Both the 2016 Vios and Yaris are slated to make their Philippine debut soon.
