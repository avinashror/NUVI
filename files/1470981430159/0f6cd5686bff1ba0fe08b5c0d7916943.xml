RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) -- Taxi drivers in Rio de Janeiro are planning a demonstration on Friday morning in the immediate vicinity of the Olympic Park to protest the use of ride-sharing program Uber.
The U.S. Consulate General&amp;apos;s office sent a message to U.S. citizens in Brazil on Thursday, based on information they received from organizers of the planned strike. Those organizers say they&amp;apos;re planning to close avenues around the Olympic Park, and doing so at rush hour could snarl traffic.
The message says &quot;such an event would affect transport for visitors to venues in the Olympic Park.&quot;
There was no immediate comment from local organizers about whether they were concerned about the planned strike.
Uber has been the target of scorn from taxi drivers around the world, including demonstrations in Paris, New York, Chicago and Mexico City.
