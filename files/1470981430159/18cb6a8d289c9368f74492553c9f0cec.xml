Citigroup has a &quot;buy&quot; recommendation and $34.94 price target on Caltex. Sasha Woolley by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald Joyce Moullakis Caltex may be the only likely bidder of Woolworths&apos; petrol station business, Citi analyst Dale Koenders wrote in a research note on Friday.
As revealed by Street Talk , Morgan Stanley has been mandated to sell the division which is expected to be worth between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion,
Sources said the US investment bank had been working on a potential sale in recent months and had reached out to interested parties.
&quot;We think Caltex is one of the few companies that could be interested, if the price is right,&quot; Koenders said.
&quot;We estimate that a $1.5 billion acquisition could add 5 per cent to 8 per cent earnings per share growth depending on if Caltex can change credit rating metrics, and any resulting need for equity (small).&quot;
