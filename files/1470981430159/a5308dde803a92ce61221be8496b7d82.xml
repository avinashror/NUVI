DENVER BUSINESS JOURNAL - SMA Solar, the German manufacturer of solar power inverters, will shut down its manufacturing plant in Denver — affecting about 280 full-time employees — as it attemps to survive a global wave of consolidation in the industry, the company said Thursday.

A story from Reuters indicated that 280 jobs would be affected, according to the company. 
“The acceleration of price pressure in the solar industry has been unexpectedly strong in recent weeks. We therefore immediately initiated measures to lower our break-even point even further,” SMA’s CEO Pierre-Pascal Urbon said in a statement. The announcement didn’t give a timeline for the closure.
