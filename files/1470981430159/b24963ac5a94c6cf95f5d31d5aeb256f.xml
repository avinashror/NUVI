COLUMBIA, SC - For the first time since 1992, Columbia is hosting the South Atlantic League All-Star Game. 
Spirit Communications Park will be the site of the 2017 event, the team announced Thursday night during the Columbia Fireflies&apos; game with Greensboro. 
The announcement came one inning after team officials formally accepted the 2016 &quot;Ball Park of the Year&quot; Award from Ball Park Digest. 
The All-Star game will be played June 20, 2017 with a home run derby, fan fest, all-star gala and other events taking place during All-Star week. 
That 1992 SAL All-Star Game at Capital City Stadium saw former Yankees pitcher and ALCS MVP Andy Pettite make an appearance. 
Recently, the SAL All-Star Game has seen the likes of Bryce Harper and Madson Bumgarner come through along with Hall of Famers Tom Glavine, Nolan Ryan, Ryne Sandberg and Steve Carlton.
