<topic_text>
This is the 50 th year of the Washington County Fair. It is Rhode Island’s biggest agricultural event. Contestants from Rhode Island farms bring not only their beloved animals to be shown and judged, but also their produce, handiwork and 4H projects. Music is a prime attraction, with nationally known country acts performing nightly in the pine grove. The fair, on Route 112 in Richmond, just south of Route 138, runs Wednesday through Sunday, roughly 9 a.m. to 10 p.m., although Sunday closes earlier. Tickets are $10, children 10 and younger get in free. Parking, performances, exhibits and competitions are included in the ticket price. Midway rides and food are extra, and booths offer items for sale. For more details, schedules and directions, visit www.washingtoncountyfair-ri.com . —Michael Delaney is The Providence Journal&apos;s managing editor of visuals.
