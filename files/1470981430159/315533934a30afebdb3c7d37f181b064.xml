Disney World wraps up the Main Street Electrical Parade&apos;s six-year run Times staff I want to see more articles tagged I&apos;m already following articles tagged The Main Street Electrical Parade will be discontinued at Disney World in October, the park says. [Disney Parks Blog] 
The Main Street Electrical Parade featuring illuminated floats such as Cinderella&apos;s pumpkin carriage has entertained crowds at Disney World&apos;s Magic Kingdom for decades. Related News/Archive Disney makes Cinderella&apos;s castle available for weddings 3 Months Ago 
Today the Disney Parks Blog announced the long-running, after-dark parade will end its run at the Orlando theme park on Oct. 9, before heading to Disneyland in California for a limited-time encore. 
The parade, featuring iconic Disney characters such as Alice from Alice in Wonderland riding atop a brightly-lit mushroom set to coordinated music, features more than half a million individual lights, according to the park. 
It originally debuted at Disneyland in 1972 and was brought to Orlando several years later where it ran until 1991, according to Yesterland , which tracks the history of defunct Disney attractions. The parade has come and gone twice more since then, but has run regularly at the Magic Kingdom since 2010. 
For those hoping to see the parade before its gone, it is scheduled to run most nights at the Magic Kingdom through Oct. 9. It does not happen during Mickey&apos;s Not-So-Scary Halloween Party nights. 
More information on dates and times for the parade is at Waltdisneyworld.com . Disney World wraps up the Main Street Electrical Parade&apos;s six-year run 08/11/16 [Last modified: Thursday, August 11, 2016 1:02pm]
