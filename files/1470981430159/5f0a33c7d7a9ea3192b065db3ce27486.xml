Waze adds feature to prevent hot car deaths It&apos;s called the Child Reminder Alert Austin Hasenmueller Published: Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) (WIAT) 
( WIAT ) — No one wants to think that they would leave their child in the backseat of a hot car, but every summer there are stories about parents forgetting their child in the backseat- many of them dying from heatstroke. 
So far this year we have seen 26 kids die in hot cars in the U.S. 
The GPS app Waze has come up with a way to help prevent the heat deaths of children and pets with a new safety feature. It’s called the Child Reminder Alert. 
The alert will remind you to check the car before you leave when it thinks you’re done with your trip. The alerts can be updated and turned on and off at any time and you can also customize the messaging for your reminders 
If you don’t have it already, you can download the Waze app on your mobile device right now. Share this:
