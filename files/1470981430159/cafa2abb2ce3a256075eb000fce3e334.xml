(CNN) – We all know it’s important to take care of our oral health but something that tends to get overlooked is teeth grinding. Because this typically happens when we’re not awake, most people aren’t aware of how harmful it can be. Whether it’s brought on by stress or anxiety. 
Teeth grinding is not uncommon, because it often happens during sleep, most people aren’t even aware they’re doing it. That can pose a problem. 
Experts say grinding or clenching your teeth on a regular basis can not only damage your pearly whites. However can cause other health issues by putting pressure on the muscles and tissues around your jaw. 
In some cases, the chronic grinding can result in fracturing a tooth or worse, a permanent loss. So what can you do to prevent this? 
Talk to your dentist. They may recommend a mouth guard to protect your teeth from grinding during sleep. You can also try avoiding anything that contains caffeine, like sodas, coffee and chocolate.Cutting back on the alcohol. Grinding tends to get worse after a few drinks. Don’t chew on pen caps or anything that isn’t food. Including gum. Chewing gum only allows your jaw muscles to get used to clenching and that’s what you want to avoid. Share this:
