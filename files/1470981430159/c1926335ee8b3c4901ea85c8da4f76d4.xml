A 64-YEAR-OLD Mutoko man allegedly raped two mentally challenged sisters after pouncing on the teenagers, as they were doing their laundry at a nearby river. 
BY CHARLES LAITON 
Michael Sakambuyi (64) is alleged to have initially raped the 19-year-old woman, while her 14-year-old sister stood-by watching. He then turned on the latter and repeated the abuse, while the elder sister also stood by witnessing her younger sister being sexually attacked. 
According to court papers, the incident leading to Sakambuyi’s arrest occurred on a date unknown to the State, but between January and July this year. 
The State alleges on the day in question, the two sisters had gone to a nearby river to do some laundry, when Sakambuyi arrived and ordered the elder sister to lie on a rock after convincing her he wanted to examine her private parts in order to marry her if she accepted his love proposal. 
The complainant complied and Sakambuyi raped her once, while her sister watched. 
Sakambuyi then turned to the other and asked her to have sexual intercourse with him, claiming he was going to marry them both. 
When the teenagers arrived home, they both narrated their ordeals to their stepmother, who then took them to their elder sister and a police report was made, leading to Sakambuyi’s arrest. 
The two sisters were later referred to Mutoko District Hospital, where examinations were conducted and it was established the pair had been sexually abused. 
This week, Sakambuyi approached the High Court, seeking to be remanded out of custody on bail pending trial and his application was set down for hearing before Justice Priscilla Munangati-Manongwa.
