KOTA BAHARU, Aug 12: PAS will sue Sarawak Report over the news portal’s report on the party, said its deputy spiritual (Mursyidul Am) leader Datuk Ahmad Yakob. 
“According to the decision made by PAS deputy president (Datuk Tuan Ibrahim Tuan Man) the lawsuit will be instituted (against Sarawak Report). Whether it’s going to be done in England, depends..,” he told reporters after sending off 150 haj pilgrims at Kompleks Islam Jubli Perak, Panji here, last night. 
On Monday, Tuan Ibrahim was reported to have stated that the party would take legal action against Sarawak Report for tarnishing PAS’ image and that of Islam with an allegedly malicious report about the party. 
Meanwhile, Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department Senator Datuk Dr Asyraf Wajdi Dusuki, Tabung Haji chairman Datuk Seri Abdul Azeez Abdul Rahim and Lembaga Tabung Haji board member Tan Sri SHukry Mohd Salleh were also present at the send-off ceremony. 
A total of 1,600 Muslims in Kelantan are expected to perform the haj this season.– Bernama
