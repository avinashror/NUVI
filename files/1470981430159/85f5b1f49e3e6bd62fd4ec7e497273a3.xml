Donald Trump suggests trying Americans at Guantanamo Bay CBS News 1 hr ago Emily Schultheis Â© REUTERS/Eric Thayer 2016-08-09t234527z481093163s1betunnkxaartrmadp3usa-election-trump.jpg Donald Trump suggested in an interview Thursday that he might allow Americans accused of terrorism to be tried at the Guantanamo Bay detention center in Cuba.
&quot;Well, I know that they want to try them in our regular court systems, and I don&apos;t like that at all, I don&apos;t like that at all,&quot; he told the Miami Herald. &quot;I would say they could be tried there, that&apos;ll be fine.&quot;
Current federal law prohibits U.S. citizens from being tried in military tribunals. Of Guantanamo, Trump has previously suggested he would &quot;load it up with bad dudes.&quot;
&quot;I want to make sure that if we have radical Islamic terrorists, we have a very safe place to keep &apos;em and we have a word, those are words our president won&apos;t even issue,&quot; he said. &quot;He&apos;s allowing people to get out that are terrible people. He&apos;s allowing a lot of people out of Guantanamo that should not be released.&quot;
Trump has come under fire for other comments he&apos;s made recently on the topic of terrorism -- namely his suggestion Wednesday night that President Obama is &quot;the founder of ISIS.&quot;
&quot;I will tell you that as far as Guantanamo is concerned I want to make sure, 100 percent sure, that if we&apos;re going to release people, number one they&apos;re going to be people that can be released and it&apos;s going to be safe to release them and there are plenty of bad ones out there and I&apos;d use it for that,&quot; Trump continued.

Darn right! Guilty till proven innocent! That&apos;s what this country was founded.... Wait a minute, that doesn&apos;t sound accurate. Does sound a lot like a dictatorship. And for those of you that say the pres can&apos;t do that. Bush signed an executive order allowing it to happen. Called the homeland security act. There are not really that many checks to stop a president from ignoring the constitution and doing what ever he wants if he knows where the loop holes are. And this is just the stuff that falls out of his mouth, who could even imagine the stuff floating around in his head that he is to afraid to say.
