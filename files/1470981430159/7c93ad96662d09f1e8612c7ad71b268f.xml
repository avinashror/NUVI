WARNING GRAPHIC MATERIAL-- This subreddit contains graphic material that involves wild animals hunting and killing prey, fighting over dominance, and feeding. If this is not something you can handle, please leave immediately. 
WE DO NOT CONDONE HURTING, MAIMING, AND TRAINING ANIMALS TO BE USED FOR ANIMAL FIGHTING. WE DO NOT CONDONE ANIMAL VIOLENCE FOR SPORT. 
This sub is here so we may appreciate the brutal and ugly side of the wild kingdom in its natural habitat 
Any posts that have excessive gore or blood in the thumbnail or video MUST be tagged as NSFW. 
This is not a sub to post fights of people. 
Humans causing the violence or faciliating violence of animals will be taken down. Animals that attack humans in the wild are allowed. 
Posts of people feeding an animal are no longer allowed, lets keep content as natural as possible 
Weather patterns, abnormal flora, and anything else naturally occurring can be considered metal. 
Clickbait, Buzzfeed lists, and all other spammy bullshit will be taken down immediately 
SHITPOSTING: the only shitposting allowed is animals who are listening to metal music (Ex: headbangin horse, or lead singer rooster) 
Don&apos;t be dicks to each other. 
/u/kforrest59 is God on this sub, His will is law... gifts and sacrifices are accepted.
