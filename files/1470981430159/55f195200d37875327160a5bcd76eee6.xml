COLUMBUS ( WSYX/WTTE ) -- Need a good night&apos;s sleep? Turn off that light! 
And we&apos;renot talking about the light next to your bed. 
Sleep expert Dr. Aneesa Das, from the OSU Wexner Medical Center, says screens have contributed to one of the biggest changes in sleep behavior in the past ten years. &quot;We are often taking our smart devices- our smart phones, our smart tablets, our laptops- into bed with us, which means we&apos;re using them later and later and later,&quot; said Das. 
She says that affects us in three ways: First: Your body doesn&apos;t get the cue to go to sleep. Two: &quot;It&apos;s much harder to put it away,&quot; Das said. &quot;It&apos;s much easier to get on Facebook one hour too long. Three: the light emitted - some researchers believe- might actually shift our clocks later and later so when we get the blue light, it might be affecting our sleep at night as well.&quot; 
She says there are apps that can filter out the blue light entirely at night. But Das has a better solution. 
&quot;I try to tell people to turn off all electronics an hour before bedtime,&quot; said Das. &quot;I think that allows us the couple of things. It gives us some time off of the screen. And it allows us to have a routine and and a routine into transition and into sleep.&quot; 
Bottom line, put the gadgets to bed. close
