EAST LONGMEADOW, Mass. (WWLP) –“But I sti haven’t found what I’m lookin’ fo .” 
Close your eyes and you would think it was Cher from 1990 on the stage in East Longmeadow. The heat and humidity kept the crowd down a little for performance of Cher tribute Artist “Dark Lady.” 
This was the final installment of the East Longmeadow Rotary Club Summer Concert Series. “Oh, we love it here,” Peter Wojtowicz told 22News. “Friendly people. Good venue. Love Cher. We’ve seen her before, and of course, we got you.” 
22News’ own Sy Becker introduced every act of the concert series, as he does every summer. The concerts are held on the grounds of East Longmeadow High School. Share this:
