Audit of Calif. Prison Suicides Underway Posted on August 11, 2016 FRESNO, Calif. (KMJ) — The California Joint Legislative Audit Committee has approved an audit, looking into the suicide prevention and reduction policies at prisons throughout the state. 
The suicide rate among prisoners at the Institution for Women, during an 18-month period from 2014 to 2015, was 8 times the national average, and 5 times that for the entire California prison system. 
Some lawmakers are pushing for increased mental health care and other inmate support services. 
The auditor is set to issue a report, once the months-long audit is concluded.
