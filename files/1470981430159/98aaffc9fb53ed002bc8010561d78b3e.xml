Acting U.S. attorney named in Colorado Denver Business Journal , KUSA 3:30 PM. MDT August 11, 2016 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST 
DENVER BUSINESS JOURNAL - Bob Troyer has been named acting U.S. attorney for Colorado, effective Thursday 
His appointment follows the departure of the state&apos;s top federal prosecutor John Walsh, who had the post since 2010 and was the longest serving U.S. attorney for Colorado since the 1980s. Walsh announced his plans to step down two weeks ago; his last day was Wednesday. 
The permanent U.S. attorney is appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Troyer most likely will serve out the remainder of the Obama administration. 
Troyer served in the Colorado U.S. Attorney’s Office from 1999 to 2004 as a drug and violent-crime prosecutor. For six years after that he worked as a partner in the Denver office of Hogan Lovells, chairing the Colorado litigation department. 
He returned to the Colorado U.S. Attorney’s Office in October 2010 as the First Assistant U.S. Attorney, the position he has filled for the last six years.
