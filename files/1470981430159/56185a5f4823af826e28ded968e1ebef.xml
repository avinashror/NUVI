Oil prices ticked higher on Friday in Asia morning trade after Saudi Arabia said it would work with other oil producers to stabilize prices, a comment interpreted by some market players that the world’s biggest oil producer could be on board for a collective production freeze.
The comment by Saudi’s energy minister Kahlid al-Falih boosted oil prices by more than 4% overnight , propelling both U.S. and Brent, the international benchmark, to a three-week high.
“This has most likely caused some investors to close out their recent bearish bets, pushing prices higher,” ANZ Research said.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light, sweet crude futures for delivery in September CLU6, +0.94% traded at $44.04 a barrel, up, $0.55, or 1.3% in the Globex electronic session. October Brent crude LCOV6, +0.67% on London’s ICE Futures exchange rose $0.45, or 1%, to $46.49 a barrel.
Prices have been moving sideways as traders and analysts are divided on how major producers, especially those inside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, will do to hasten the rebalance in the oil market.
This week, OPEC announced the 14-member bloc will meet on the sidelines of an energy conference next month in Algeria and that the group will “continue to monitor development closely,” adding that it is in “constant deliberation” on way to help restore stability and order in the oil market.

However, with Saudi Arabia pumping at record speed — 10.67 million barrels a day in July — some analysts are casting doubts over the kingdom’s sincerity.
“We’d also note that while Saudi Arabia may be willing to talk, their recent actions have included record production in July to meet both domestic power-sector demand and exports, and a price cut for September deliveries to Asia,” said Tim Evans, a Citi Futures analyst.
“This doesn’t look like a country that is giving up its fight for market share,” he added.
Despite the ramp up in production by OPEC, global output growth is seen lagging behind demand, thanks to the dwindling output from non-OPEC players and robust demand, the International Energy Agency said Thursday.
It forecasts non-OPEC production to fall by 900,000 barrels this year, before rebounding by 300,000 barrels a day in 2017. The Paris-based agency, however, gave a grimmer outlook on demand, estimating global oil-demand growth to slow to 1.2 million barrels a day in 2017 from 1.4 million barrels forecast for this year.
“While the downward revision of global demand is expected, we still believe that non-OPEC supply contraction is underestimated by the IEA,” Bernstein Research said in a note.
Nymex reformulated gasoline blendstock for September RBU6, +0.43% , the benchmark gasoline contract, fell 17 points to $1.36 a gallon, while September diesel traded at $1.3835, 14 points lower.
ICE gasoil for September changed hands at $405 a metric ton, up $2.00 from Thursday’s settlement.
