DENVER BUSINESS JOURNAL - Red Rocks Community College next week will open a $22.5 million expansion of its Arvada satellite campus that the college says will transform it into a full-service campus for students. 
The 55,000-square-foot building will officially open Tuesday, Aug. 16. It will serve students pursuing degrees in occupations such as medical and physician assistants, nurse aides and diagnostic medical sonography. Other certifications offered there will include nursing and social work. 
&quot;The new building and the significant remodel of the existing building allow the college to provide expanded opportunities for our students — state-of-the art classrooms, labs and study areas create an exceptional learning environment,&quot; said Bill McGreevy, a dean of instruction and interim Arvada campus director.
