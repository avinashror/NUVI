Road rage killer gunned down WFLA&apos;s Melanie Michael Published: August 11, 2016, 9:16 am Updated: Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) A Florida man who had just been released from prison after serving time for a road rage killing was shot and killed in another road rage incident Wednesday morning. 
(WFLA) A Florida man was shot and killed during a road rage encounter Wednesday morning, shortly after being released from prison where he was serving time for a road rage killing. 
40-year-old Gary Durham has done time in prison for grand theft, aggravated assault, and for a road rage related killing back in 2001. 
In 2001, a fight in traffic led Durham to punch 48-year-old cancer survivor Tim Gibbs so hard that it left him brain dead in the hospital where he died days later. 
Wednesday, he picked another fight in traffic, only this time, he was the one killed. 
Deputies say Durham’s shooter was questioned and released. 
Gibbs’ widow calls this poetic justice and says Durham can not hurt anyone else’s loved ones anymore.
