CO2 Solutions Wins Patent Challenge Canada NewsWire
QUEBEC CITY, Aug. 10, 2016
TSX-V: CST
QUEBEC CITY , Aug. 10, 2016 /CNW/ - CO 2 Solutions Inc. (or the “Corporation”) (TSX-V: CST), the leader in the field of enzyme-enabled carbon capture technology, today announced that broad intellectual property (IP) rights in Denmark have been upheld by the Danish Patent Office. In the re-examination decision, the Danish Patent Office maintained the issued claims in the Corporation’s registered Utility Model #BR 201400144 entitled SYSTEM FOR CO2 CAPTURE USING PACKED REACTOR AND ABSORPTION MIXTURE WITH MICRO-PARTICLES INCLUDING BIOCATALYSTS. In fact, all 87 claims of the utility model were maintained in unamended form, meaning that the Corporation’s creation, as defined in the claims, is considered to be novel and distinct over the prior art.
The decision came pursuant to a challenge filed by Akermin Inc., a U.S. company that had intended to utilize similar CO 2 capture technology for a biogas-related project in Denmark , known as ENZUP. CO 2 Solutions had notified Akermin’s Danish ENZUP partners of their impending infringement of the Corporation’s IP, subsequent to which Akermin filed its challenge.
“This decision is the third in Denmark upholding all of our intellectual property claims in the face of vigorous opposition by Akermin and other ENZUP partners,” stated Evan Price , President and Chief Executive Officer of CO 2 Solutions. “The decision clearly confirms our ownership of the IP related to enzyme-enabled carbon capture, the most economical and cleanest commercial technology available to date for this purpose. While we offered the ENZUP partners a single commercial licence for use of the CO 2 Solutions’ IP in their project, it appears that, pursuant to this decision, Akermin has indefinitely ceased operations and the ENZUP project itself, in Denmark , has been cancelled. CO 2 Solutions welcomes initiatives to implement carbon capture technology, but shall defend the Corporation’s IP wherever we observe actual or imminent infringement on our rights, as we have done successfully in Denmark .”
