Dr. Kerry Sachetta has had a long career in education, but he may have a future as a private investigator if he wants it. 
The assistant superintendent of the Joplin School District and a group of concerned Parkwood High School alumni this week cracked the case surrounding the disappearance of the former school’s unofficial mascot, Brutus the Bear. 
Created in 1976 by Parkwood graduate Randy Branham, Brutus became an almost 6-foot-tall icon for Parkwood students. Randy Branham’s brother, Keith, was the president of the class of &apos;76. The class asked Randy, who graduated in 1972, to begin doing some basic woodworking to create a mascot the class could leave behind. 
Brutus found a home on a cafeteria wall at Parkwood where he endeared himself to students over the years. Many classes became so attached to Brutus that they requested he make an appearance at class reunions years later. Sometime in the late 1990s or early 2000s, Sachetta said, the bear didn’t return, possibly after a particularly rowdy reunion. For more than 15 years, no one knew — or was willing to say — where Brutus wound up, Sachetta said. 
After years of chasing leads and pursuing sources, Sachetta said Brutus has made his homecoming. 
“The more I talked to classes about it, the more I understood how much it meant to the classes. So I knew it was very important to folks,” Sachetta said. Story continues below video 
“I was given this individual’s cellphone number, and so I just kept pressing,” he said of the search. 
The bear was returned in less than perfect condition, Sachetta said, so he contacted Randy Branham to see if the mascot’s original creator would be willing to spruce it back up. Branham agreed and hopes to have Brutus restored in time for the 40-year reunion of the class of 1976. 
“It’s that attachment that the alumni of all the years were there,” Branham said. “It’s something that they were looking for. Looking to get something back and get a good story. … I think everyone was just so amazed to get it. You could reproduce it, possibly, but it still wouldn’t be the original.” 
Kimberly Vesecky, a 1980 Parkwood graduate, set up a GoFundMe page where classmates could make donations to cover the mascot&apos;s “medical expenses.” The account reached its goal of raising $1,000 on the crowdfunding site in approximately 19 hours, she said. 
“I felt like Jerry Lewis in the telethon, I was sitting there watching it and it was like ‘boom,’ just like that,” Vesecky said. “Everybody just wants to see that bear back. I mean, he’s a legend. He’s an urban legend of Joplin.&quot; 
While people may have wondered where Brutus has been over the years, she said, &quot;nobody really cares now where he was. We just want him to come home.” Sign Up / Sign In With your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}
