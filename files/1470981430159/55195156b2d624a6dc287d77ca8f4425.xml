NEW YORK, Aug. 9, 2016
NEW YORK , Aug. 9, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — From the Beacon Theatre in Manhattan to the Top of the Standard in Los Angeles to Lola’s Trailer Park in Fort Worth, TX , musicians are banding together for The Concert Across America to End Gun Violence on Sunday, September 25th . Jackson Browne , Rosanne Cash , Marc Cohn and Harlem’s Gospel for Teens will headline the concert scheduled for the Beacon Theatre on Sept. 25. Tickets go on sale Friday, August 12 at 12:00pm at http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/3B005106BA741DB9 and all Ticketmaster locations. #ConcertAcrossAmerica to #EndGunViolence.
Spearheaded by Massachusetts -based Stop Handgun Violence (SHV), Faiths United to Prevent Gun Violence, and dozens of other organizations committed to reducing gun violence, this nationwide effort will feature a diverse array of artists performing at venues ranging from churches and school gymnasiums to honky-tonks, hotel rooftops and theatres.
From the Arlington Theatre in Santa Barbara, CA to the Regent Theatre in Arlington, MA , artists will be performing to give voice to the more than five million Americans who have been murdered by a firearm since the mass shooting at the University of Texas on Aug. 1, 1966 .
SHV Founder John Rosenthal said, “In the midst of America’s epidemic of gun violence that results in 90 deaths, over 200 injuries and a mass shooting every day, this powerful coast-to-coast concert and organizing effort will raise awareness and – very importantly – get out the vote on gun violence prevention in the November elections and beyond.”
