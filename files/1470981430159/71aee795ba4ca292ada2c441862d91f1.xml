Doppler/Horst will likely move on to the Round of 16, either as a top third-place pool finisher or through a last chance lucky loser match. The Canadian men, however, are eliminated from the Olympic competition. 
Men’s preliminary: Bockermann/Fluggen (GER) vs. Liamin/Barsouk (RUS) 10:00 p.m. ET REPLAY Liamin/Barsouk finish preliminary play with a 21-14, 21-17 win that puts them as the No. 2 finisher in Pool B.

Both teams finished at the bottom of Pool B and must wait until preliminary play concludes to find out if they qualify for a last chance lucky loser match. 
Women’s preliminary: Walsh Jennings/Ross (USA) vs. Forrer/Verge-Depre (SUI) 8:00 p.m. ET REPLAY Kerri Walsh Jennings and April Ross won their third and final match of pool play in a shockingly close duel against Switzerland. The U.S. women quickly took the first set but the Swiss women challenged back in the second set, taking a 24-22 win that marked Walsh Jenning’s second match set loss of her Olympic career. In the third set, Forrer dove for a ball, injuring her neck and took a five minute break to receive medical attention. The U.S. women kept their momentum to win 21-13, 22-24, 15-12. The U.S. women will advance while the Swiss must wait for pool play to end to find out if they qualify for a last chance lucky loser match. 
Women’s preliminary: Alfaro/C. Charles (CRC) vs. Pazo/ Agudo (VEN) 5:30 p.m. ET REPLAY The Venezuelan women bested Costa Rica to win their final match of pool play 21-16, 21-19. Neither team finished among the top two teams of Pool F but one team may qualify for a last chance lucky loser match. 
Women’s preliminary: Agatha/Barbara (BRA) vs. Elsa/Liliana (ESP) 4:30 p.m. ET REPLAY In a stunning upset, tenth-seeded Elsa/Liliana swept second-seeded Agatha/Barbara 21-17, 22-20.

He took a medical timeout before returning to the court but moved gingerly to avoid further injury. The Brazilians swept Italy 21-19, 21-16 and will advance to the Round of 16 though Alison’s injury will surely cause concern for the team. 
Women’s preliminary: Wang/Yue (CHN) vs. Artacho del Solar/Laird (AUS) 12:00 p.m. ET REPLAY China beat Australia 21-16, 21-11. The Chinese women are 2-1 in Pool C while the Australians are down 0-3 and eliminated from the tournament.

Spain took the first set 21-19. The U.S. men rallied back to take the second set 21-16. In the third and final set the U.S. men lost momentum after Spain challenged a play, forcing the match to stop for several minutes as both teams pushed back on the referee’s call.
