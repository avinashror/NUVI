An Orange business has been left with a significant bill after someone senselessly tried to put their boot through a glass door in Cameron Place. 
The front door of Orange Funerals was smashed on Wednesday evening after staff and the owner went home for the day. 
Funeral director John McDonell said he left work at 4.30pm that afternoon and returned after 8pm to get some paperwork. That’s when noticed the broken glass in one of his front doors and boot-print on the other door. 
“I don’t think they were interested in stealing anything. Someone just wanted to do some damage,” Mr McDonell said. 
Mr McDonell said in the past three years he’d never had any trouble but would replace the broken door as soon as possible. 
“It’s surprising because the place is lit up like a Christmas tree at night, whoever it was they were in full view,” he said. 
“It’s just the two front doors they’ve tried to attack. It’s strange because Tony Leahey’s dealership is even brighter than my building [at night]. 
“It’s a pain, you’re working everyday keep the bills paid and they throw you another one [bill]. It’s money that you don’t have to spend,” Mr McDonell said. 
While the area is well lit, Mr McDonell said there was little traffic once businesses closed during the day and because there were few houses nearby. 
“There’s not many homes around, it’s mostly businesses, it’s pretty quiet at this end of town, especially at night-time,” he said. 
Mr McDonell said the building had strong security measures in place. 
Canobolas Local Area Command acting Inspector Mick White said there weren’t many reports of businesses being vandalised but urged business owners to invest in CCTV. 
“CCTV is another tool at our disposal, we can readily circulate images,” Inspector White said. He said police regularly patrolled areas like Cameron Place as part of their duties. 
It’s not the first time crooks have targeted a business in Cameron Place. Last month, thieves broke into Orange Wholesale Automotive and stole a car after removing a panel from the security fence. 
Anyone with information on vandalism can contact Orange police on 6363 6399 or Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000. Latest News
