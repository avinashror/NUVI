Men’s preliminary: Fijalek/Prudel (POL) vs. Grimalt M./Grimalt E. (CHI) 11:00 a.m. ET REPLAY Poland’s Fijalek/Prudel won 21-13, 16-21, 15-11 to beat Chilean cousins Marco and Esteban Grimalt. Chile is out of the Olympic beach volleyball tournament and Poland must wait to see where they rank in pool standings but will likely play in a lucky loser match. 
Men’s preliminary: Schalk/Saxton (CAN) vs. Diaz/Gonzalez (CUB) 10:00 a.m. ET REPLAY The Cuban men swept Schalk/Saxton to win their third consecutive match of pool play. Diaz/Gonzalez entered the tournament as the 21-seed but managed to top third-seeded Brazilians and eighth-seeded Latvians on their way to qualify for the Round of 16. Diaz/Gonzalez will enter the elimination round on Aug. 12 while the Canadians must wait for Pool D play to end to see if they will participate in a lucky loser match. 
Women’s preliminary: Larissa/talita (BRA) vs. Kolosinska/Brzostek (POL) 9:00 a.m. ET REPLAY Top-seeded Brazilian’s Larissa/Talita swept Poland in straight sets 21-10, 21-15. Brazil finishes at the top of Pool A and Kolosinska/Brzostek finish second with both teams headed to the Round of 16. Share this:
