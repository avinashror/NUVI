Barack Obama gets just as nervous as Aly Raisman’s parents watching gymnastics Barack Obama gets just as nervous as Aly Raisman&apos;s parents watching gymnastics NBC Olympics.com Published: Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) 
When Aly Raisman returned for the Rio Olympics, she brought along a few things fans might remember from London: her super-difficult floor routine, the leadership skills that got her voted team captain twice, and her hilariously nervous parents, Lynn and Rick Raisman. 
Their squirming reactions to Raisman’s routines show how torturous it can be to be the parent of an Olympic athlete. 
President Barack Obama’s two teenager daughters may not be elite gymnasts, but he can still relate. 
Two days after the Final Five gymnastics team won gold, Barack and Michelle Obama discussed their favorite Olympic sports and moments in a video for USA Today . 
Michelle said she’d love to compete in gymnastics if she had the body type. 
“I’m not built for gymnastics, clearly, I’m a little too tall. But they are phenomenal. And if I could flip like that, I would do it in a heartbeat,” she said. 
Barack agreed that gymnastics is “spectacular” but admits that he doesn’t really enjoy watching it. 
“Anything involving your head pointing down is not something I do. It’s too tense. I’m like, ‘Oh, she’s going to fall!&apos;” he said, doing a uncanny if inadvertant impression of the Raisman’s. 
Then the Obama’s shared a message for Team USA: “Bring home the gold.” 
With a team gold already in her pocket and two more chances for medals in today’s all-around final and the floor final, Raisman will strive to do just that. Share this:
