How young is too young to get married? A legislation is considered next year to ban child marriage in Massachusetts Tiffany Chan, 22News State House Correspondent Published: August 11, 2016, 6:06 pm Updated: Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) 
BOSTON, Mass. (WWLP) – These are some pretty shocking statistics. Almost 200 children were married in Massachusetts between 2010 and 2014, according to the state Department of Public Health. 
All stems from a report by the Boston Globe that found 85-percent of those children were girls who married significantly older men. This isn’t against the law. Minors of all ages can get married in Massachusetts as long as they have parental consent, and then a judge’s approval. 
Critics argue that it’s tough to determine whether teens are getting married because they want to, or if they’re being pressured by their families. 22News asked Governor Charlie Baker today whether the state should set a minimum age requirement for marriage. 
Governor Charlie Baker, said, “Frankly, it was news to me, but it’s not something that’s been raised by the courts previously. I plan to ask some of the folks in the children’s advocacy community and see what they say.” 
Newton State Representative Kay Khan is considering legislation next year to ban child marriage in Massachusetts. Share this:
