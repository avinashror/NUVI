Boy, 10, Starts His Own Lawn Mowing Business to Help Mom Pay For His School Supplies Inside Edition 7 hrs ago Leah Collie © Provided by CBS Interactive Inc. Tyran Bell decided to get to work to help his mom cover the costs of school supplies. A young entrepreneur paid for his own school supplies by launching and running his own business mowing neighbors&apos; lawns.
Tyran Bell, 10, made the decision to open up shop in Wilmington, North Carolina because he knew his mother , Tara Lewis, might struggle to afford supplies and clothing for the new school year.
“I tried to help my mom by buying my own school supplies,” Tyran told InsideEdition.com.
So he turned to Facebook, where he advertised his mowing services on a local community page. He received dozens of messages from neighbors.
“A lot of people have been messaging me and asking if Tyran can cut their yard,” his mom said. “They’ve also donated as well; they’re doing their part as a supportive town.”
Among them was Theresa Babb, A1 Security Services owner and Wilmington resident . After seeing Tyran’s Facebook post, she offered to collect new lawn equipment and donated school supplies and clothing at her office space.
Any extra supplies and clothing will be donated to other kids in need.
Tyran, who is now ready to begin fifth grade, says business is booming and he might even hire some new recruits.
“We are so grateful for everyone who contributed,” his mom said. “We are truly blessed.”
