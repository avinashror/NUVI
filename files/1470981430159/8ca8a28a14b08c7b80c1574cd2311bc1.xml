Controversial pocket park sale in Forrest Hill on Auckland&apos;s North Shore rejected by Auckland Council Kids&apos; march remembers Moko Rangitoheriri 
A desperate dad waved down a cop on the beat to help deliver a baby. 
It was shaping up as a regular Friday afternoon shift for Constable Will Pentelowâ in Milton, south Otago. 
&quot;I was doing my foot patrol and was talking to a lady when a guy ran up to me in a real panic saying &apos;please help me . . . my wife is having a baby&apos;. 
&quot;The baby was well on its way.&quot; 
Pentelow said he was no stranger to the birthing process after experiencing the birth of his own baby five months ago, and having delivered another roadside baby in Waihola a year ago. 
&quot;This is becoming an annual event for me.&quot; 
The Cromwell couple, who recently relocated from Auckland, were driving to Dunedin Hospital when &quot;things progressed more than they anticipated&quot;. 
&quot;I assisted as best I could,&quot; Pentelow said. 
&quot;I was at the business end for a brief period until I asked a woman I had been talking to, Lynda Allan, &apos;for the sake of this woman&apos;s dignity she would probably appreciate you more than me&apos;.&quot; 
&quot;But I offered some advice based on my recent experience.&quot; 
Pentelow phoned the local medical centre and called St John, &quot;but purely by chance I saw an ambulance coming towards me and they stopped and assisted&quot;. 
The healthy baby girl was born in the back of the ambulance.
