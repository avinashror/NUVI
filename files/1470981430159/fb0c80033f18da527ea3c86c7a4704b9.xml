Service academy a confidence boost for school students LIBBY WILSON Last updated 17:30, August 12 2016 MARK TAYLOR/FAIRFAX NZ 
Many rugby first XV players are in Fairfield College&apos;s school service academy, says director Raynor Stott. He&apos;s pictured inspecting a Year 12 group. 
They form up and stand to attention in sync, yet few of these teenagers knew military drill two years ago. 
The change is because Hamilton&apos;s Fairfield College set up a school service academy in 2015, in partnership with the High Wire Charitable Trust. 
It&apos;s not &quot;the naughty class&quot;, and not just about directing teenagers into the military, academy director Raynor Stott said. CHRISTEL YARDLEY/FAIRFAX NZ 
A second academy, also supported by the High Wire Charitable Trust, runs at Melville High School. Pictured from left - in 2015 - are Keleni Veituna, 16, Mina Te Hana, 15, and David Pearce, 16, being instructed by director Neville Johnson. 
It teaches students about the defence forces, but also opens their eyes to jobs in the fire service, police, or a hospital - any jobs that involve helping others.

The course also covers skills such as parade drill training, rock climbing, navigation and high ropes. 
And there&apos;s another academy supported by the same trust on the other side of Hamilton, at Melville High School. 
The academies are in their second year and Fairfield has about 60 students signed up, across three year levels. 
The teenagers pick the academy as a subject, Stott said. 
&quot;We have a lot of the first XV rugby team involved in the [Year 12] class - it makes things a little bit hard during rugby season sometimes,&quot; he said. Ad Feedback 
Stott has seen massive changes in students in a year-and-a-half and a favourite memory is taking them on a high ropes course in Papakura. 
&quot;Just watching a lot of the students who were normally very boisterous got very quiet when they were starting to come to the heights ... but they would still push through that fear,&quot; he said. 
He also loves drill and outdoor activities - soon he&apos;ll take the Year 12s on a five-day tramp in Auckland&apos;s Hunua Ranges. 
In that class is 16-year-old Courtney Saunders, who said the academy boosted her confidence and set her on a career path. 
&quot;Ever since they made the service academy, I&apos;ve always wanted to join the army ... be a chef,&quot; she said. 
The 16 year old has enjoyed high ropes courses, achieved most of her assessments and hopes to carry on with service academy in Year 13. 
Wesley Paewhenua, 16, heard about the academy in assembly and thought, I could do that. 
He enjoys the bond with other class members and thinks service academy has helped with all his classes. 
&quot;I&apos;ve taken more of a leadership role because we were forced to stand up and it really helped our confidence.&quot; 
So far, his favourite memory is of a 2015 camp based at Awhitu Regional Park, on the Manukau Harbour - despite 5.30am starts. 
Fairfield College wouldn&apos;t have been able to offer a service academy without support from the High Wire Charitable Trust, principal Richard Crawford said. 
It has improved achievement for students involved and made school Anzac day celebrations more special. 
It doesn&apos;t just channel students towards service jobs - &quot;It&apos;s an opportunity to teach them some discipline, some training, some really good skills that they can use.&quot; 
Fairfield currently runs service academy programmes for Years 10, 11 and 12 and Crawford hopes to bring in a Year 13 programme. 
Melville High School runs the programme for the same year levels and has about 90 students taking part this year. 
It&apos;s magic for many, principal Clive Hamill said, teaching them to hold their heads high and speak with confidence. 
&quot;We have got several students in the academy that it&apos;s the critical aspect of their schooling. It ensures that they&apos;re engaged and want to stay at school.&quot; 
Achievement rates in the academy are also higher than the school average, he said. 
Melville High had been unsuccessful in getting a service academy through the Ministry of Education, Hamill said, so was delighted to have the trust&apos;s support. 
Director Neville Johnson, whose role is supported through the trust, has been key to its success. - Stuff
