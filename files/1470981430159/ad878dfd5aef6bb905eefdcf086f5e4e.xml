Part of hospital to be examined as officials seek source of Legi - WFSB 3 Connecticut Member Center: Part of hospital to be examined as officials seek source of Legionnaires&apos; Posted: (WFSB photo) MIDDLETOWN, CT (WFSB) - 
Officials said they&apos;ll be reexamining part of a hospital in Middletown that may be the source of a recent case of Legionnaires&apos; disease. 
A patient at the Connecticut Valley Hospital was diagnosed with the disease earlier this week. 
State health officials said they&apos;re awaiting test results of a possible second case involving a nurse who works at the facility. 
Eyewitness News was told that environmental specialists will examine Merritt Hall at CVH, which could be a possible source of contamination. 
Both patients were in the hall that&apos;s being investigated. 
If the building is found to be the source of the Legionnaires&apos;, health officials said they&apos;ll take action. 
Legionnella bacteria is typically found in either soil or water. It grows in water cooling towers, hot water tanks, large plumbing systems and air conditioning systems. If it becomes airborne, experts said it cause a very serious pneumonia.
