The Power Of MakeUp || Scary Dead Girl PRANK || Samara || GONE WRONG MUST WATCH IT TO THE END !!! This time completely different video.This is my first ever PRANK. Scary dead girl prank!! It is inspired by movie&apos;s character Samara from &quot;The Ring&quot;. We had this idea about 5 months and finally I decided to do it and I am obsest!!! Creating something creapy and scary is absolutely sick and amazing in one. With this video, I want to show you the power of MakeUp! As you can see I tried to do this look very very real.So you DO NOT need a lot of makeup YOU HAVE to keep it real as much as possible.AND finally what I want to say - never be afraid of doing something different something out of your comfort zone. Live your life absolutly FREE.And don&apos;t forget to be SAFE xD. Sometimes it goes wrong.... Love you. And BIG thanks to those of you who came to take pic with me.It&apos;sooo cool that you were thinking that everything (my look) was real .Amaaaazing!!!!
