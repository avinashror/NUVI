  Milton&apos;s run in Little League regional stopped by Pennsylvania By Sean Greene 12:20am, August 12, 2016 Milton&apos;s Chase Boyle smashed a three-run homer, but the Delaware Little League champions were eliminated from Mid-Atlantic Regional play with a 9-5 loss to the Pennsylvania state champions Thursday night. Delaware fell behind 1-0 in the top of the first, but responded in kind when Brian Sponaugle&apos;s single to right scored Aidan Major to tie the game. Keystone (Pennsylvania) then jumped ahead 5-1 in the third after three Delaware errors, but after Hunter Rauch singled and Tyler Husbands walked to lead off the 3rd inning, they could trot home on Boyle&apos;s blast to left field that brought Delaware within a run. The rally continued after a 2-plus hour lightning and rain delay, but they could not get the tying run. Pennsylvania steadily pulled away, getting a run in the 4th, and then three more in the 6th inning, including a two-run shot by Kaden Falls. Boyle added his 4th RBI in the game with a 2-out bases loaded walk in the 6th inning that allowed the tying run to come to the plate, but a strikeout ended Delaware&apos;s hopes for a 3rd trip to Williamsport in state history. Brian Sponaugle went 2-for-4 with the RBI for Milton, who also picked up hits from Timothy Hitchcock and Paris Mitchell. Copyright © Aug 12,
