No Comments While the speakers on smartphones, tablets and laptops have gotten quite a bit better over the years, there’s really no substitute for having a separate speaker for sound quality and sheer volume. There are a number of different ways to connect to a speaker too, and if it’s portable, you really need the flexibility! Enter the Willnorn SoundPlus, a slick little portable bluetooth speaker that offers four different ways for you to play music from your favorite device or devices: bluetooth 4.1 (which supports A2DP if you’re knowledgeable about the internals of bluetooth), NFC aka Near Field Communication, a direct AUX wire from your device to the speaker and even a MicroSD TF card, the same memory card you can slip into lots of smartphones and tablets. But that’s not all. The speaker also features IPx5 weather resistance, meaning that if you’re enjoying it at a picnic and it starts to rain you won’t have to worry about your SoundPlus getting hurt! Since it’s portable that means it needs to work from an internal battery — you don’t want to drag a power cord out to the picnic table! — and the SoundPlus is rated to have a battery that can play up to 24 hours of music non-stop. That’s a lot of picnic food, miles and miles of trekking, a long, long bike ride or even just plenty of time to listen without worrying about having to recharge the unit. Enough lead in, here’s my YouTube video review: Don’t forget to subscribe to my YouTube channel while you’re at it! And the SoundPlus? Here’s a handy link to pick one up at Amazon.com if you’re interested: Willnorn SoundPlus speaker at Amazon.com. $39.99 . Disclosure: Willnorn sent us a speaker to review and paid a small fee in addition to cover production expenses.
