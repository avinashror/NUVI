LeBron James has agreed to terms on a three-year, $100 million deal to re-sign with the Cleveland Cavaliers, a person with knowledge of the situation confirmed to USA TODAY Sports. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the terms of the deal are not announced. 
There is a player option on the third year of the deal, the person said. 
James, the four-time MVP who led the Cavs to their first-ever title in Cleveland last season, announced the decision in a video on the Bleacher Report platform, Uninterrupted, that was produced for his fans. 
&quot;I&apos;m re-signing back with the Cleveland Cavaliers, man, my hometown team, and I (couldn&apos;t) be more excited with this opportunity once again man, to defend our crown, defend our title,&quot; James said. &quot;We all know last year was magical, inspiring, all the words you can come up with man. It was an unbelievable season. I just can&apos;t wait to get the group back together man, the team, the franchise, and more importantly get everybody together.&quot; 
James didn&apos;t miss an opportunity to send a message to Cavs owner Dan Gilbert and general manager David Griffin, either, noting at the end of the video how Cleveland has yet to re-sign free agent shooting guard J.R. Smith. 
&quot;Let&apos;s get J.R. done - it&apos;s that time,&quot; he said with a laugh. 
ESPN first reported the financial terms of James&apos; deal.
