MINNEAPOLIS - Evan Gattis homered and had four RBIs, Carlos Correa went deep for the third straight game and the Houston Astros beat the Minnesota Twins 10-2 Thursday night to sweep a doubleheader. Houston had 16 hits in the nightcap, three fewer than it had in a 15-7 win during the day. The doubleheader was necessitated by a rainout Wednesday, a game Minnesota led 5-0 in the third before storms arrived. Jose Altuve had four hits in the first game and was 1 for 4 in the nightcap. He leads the major leagues with a .365 batting average and has reached base in 41 straight road games. Chris Devenski (1-4), who had 21 straight relief appearances after making four early season starts, allowed two hits and struck out five during five strong innings for Houston. Tommy Milone (3-4) allowed five runs and five hits in three innings, including homers to Gattis and Correa.
