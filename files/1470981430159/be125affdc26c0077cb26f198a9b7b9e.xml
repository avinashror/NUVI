Dutch firm to launch futuristic floating homes in Dubai Article Thursday, 11 August 2016 9:27 AM 
A futuristic floating homes project will be unveiled at Cityscape Global in Dubai in September. 
Dutch developer New Living on Water (NLW) will launch designs for the “organic-shaped” homes at the event, which will take place at Dubai World Trade Centre from September 6 to 8. 
The company expects regional sales of $50 million (AED184 million) over the first 12 months, and at least double that in 2017-18, it said in a statement. 
The floating homes have been developed by NLW in cooperation with CIG, an industrial shipbuilding, constructional design and complex architecture company, and the renewable energy industry worldwide. 
They were developed for a small niche-market and designed with sustainability in mind “in order to create mutual respect between humans and environment”, with renewable energy sources used as much as possible, according to NLW&apos;s managing director and co-owner, Menno de Roos. 
&quot;A lot of people nowadays live in very densely populated areas, and for most of them this is no problem in everyday life,” said Roos. &quot;But the need for some privacy and the inner need of being connected to nature has always been with us, and that&apos;s what we&apos;re offering. 

&quot;Our newly developed floating residences guarantee both the privacy and nature that people are looking for, as well as the comfort of being part of a six-star super luxury beachfront resort.&quot; 
The designs will join a huge range of projects at the 15th Cityscape Global, which will span 41,000 sq m of exhibition space. 
They include a development in Azerbaijan capital Baku, featuring an international school, world-class golf course with academy, training zones and fitness centres, in a gated community with villas, apartments, cafes, restaurants and retail outlets. 
The developers of Dreamland Country &amp; Life hope the project&apos;s location, in one of the country&apos;s &quot;most ecologically clean&quot; areas, and just a three-hour flight from Dubai, will give it traction with GCC investors and golf-lovers. 
&quot;Our climate rarely surpasses 35C, even at the height of summer when it&apos;s possible to play golf until 8.30pm,&quot; said Abdolbari Goozal, Chairman of Intersun Group of Companies. &quot;This is a landmark project in Azerbaijan which will make a significant contribution to the country&apos;s tourism, and Cityscape Global gives us a perfect opportunity to introduce it to golf and lifestyle seekers on an international scale.&quot; (Source: Menno de Roos YouTube channel)
