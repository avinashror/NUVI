ST. PAUL, Minn. - A St. Paul Police K-9 is being commended for his role in reuniting a lost toddler and his family. 
Police spokesman Steve Linders says Officer Patrick Murphy and his dog Sarik were on routine patrol Monday morning when he saw a 3-year-old boy all alone near the corner of Front and Chatsworth. The child, dressed in red pajamas, told Murphy he didn&apos;t know where his house was, said he wanted his mom, and started to cry. 
Murphy picked the boy up because his feet were sore from the sidewalk and began walking around the neighborhood, hoping the toddler would recognize the house that was his. After 30 minutes of fruitless searching, the officer decided to see if Sarik the K-9 could help.

The dog sniffed Murphy&apos;s shirt where he had been holding the boy, then began backtracking where the child had come from. They went north on Victoria, down an alley, and eventually came to a yard with a toy dump truck. Sarik stopped, Officer Murphy knocked on the door, and the boy&apos;s older sister answered. 
It turns out that the toddler&apos;s mother was at a doctor&apos;s appointment and the sister was supposed to be watching him when he wandered away.
