A Memphis International Airport security video shows the confrontation between security personnel and Hannah Cohen, a St. Jude Children&apos;s Research Hospital patient, that led Cohen to file a federal lawsuit. 
The incident happened on June 30, 2015, when Cohen, 19, and her mother, Shirley, went through security at the Memphis airport. The women were traveling back to their Chattanooga home following treatment at the Memphis-based hospital. 
The video, obtained by The Commercial Appeal, shows Cohen speaking with several security agents. When one of the agents tries to detain her, Cohen tries to punch the agent, who then slams her to the floor. She then struggles to break free as the agent tries to handcuff her. 
According to the lawsuit, an alarm went off when Hannah went through the security screening. She was described as being impaired from radiation treatment and the removal of a brain tumor. The aggressive cancer treatment left the teen with limited ability to talk, walk, stand, see and hear. 
&quot;(She) became disoriented and confused by the warning alarm and the actions of the personnel manning the security checkpoint to try to search her person because of her disability. The security personnel failed to recognize that she was confused because of her obvious disability and was unable to cooperate with the search,&quot; the lawsuit said.
