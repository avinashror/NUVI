Close Trolls Will Troll: Gymnasts Attacked On Social Media Social media has helped shed light on issues dealing with sexism and discrimination in the recent months. People taking a stand. However, cyber bullies have used the same social platforms to fuel negative sentiment during the Rio 2016 Olympics.

Social media has helped shed light on issues dealing with sexism and discrimination in the recent months. People taking a stand. However, cyber bullies have used the same social platforms to fuel negative sentiment during the Rio 2016 Olympics. 
Despite the talent seen at the Summer Olympics, the attention for Mexican Alexa Moreno wasn’t on her abilities as a gymnast, but instead on her body image. Users on Twitter criticized the gymnast who weighs 99 pounds at 4’ 11’. 


According to the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (CDC) Moreno falls into a normal weight status, according to her body mass index. 
It didn’t take a doctor to come to her defense. People immediately shut down the body shamers by showing their support for the 22-year old. 



Unfortunately, Moreno hasn’t been the only victim during the games. Gabby Douglas also experienced attacks. 
The two-time Olympic gymnast was targeted for her hair during competitions, but once again, many came to her defense. 

One person even made the obvious point that her hair can’t and won’t be perfect, after all she more focused on executing gold worthy routines. 

As the trolls keep on doing what they do best, Morena walks away an Olympic gymnast, and Gabby a two-time Gold Olympian.
