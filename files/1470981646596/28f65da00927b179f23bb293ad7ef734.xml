KUSA - For years, ModCloth has existed online as a massively popular shop that specializes in the kooky, vintage and eclectic. 
Despite its success, sometimes nothing beats the real deal. For three weeks, ModCloth will open a pop-up shop in Cherry Creek North for its diehard fans. 
Located on 180 Clayton Ln., the shop features classic pieces as well as finds tailored to Colorado. 
Denver was a hand-picked location based off the consumption seen online, according to Elizabeth Cooksey, VP of stores. 
While department store like Macy&apos;s have announced brick and mortar store closings, ModCloth is hopeful the large online fan base will draw people in the stores.Customers will have a chance to meet with stylists and physically see and touch the clothes once only available online.
