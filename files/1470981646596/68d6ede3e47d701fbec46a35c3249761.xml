Statement from PCAO Lando Voyles on Tyler Kost Case Written by SanTanValley.com on View Comments 
Pinal County Attorney Lando Voyles releases statement on Tyler Kost’s return to the Pinal County Detention Center: 
“The Pinal County Attorney’s Office acknowledges the stay issued by the Arizona Supreme Court remanding Tyler Kost back to the Pinal County Adult Detention Center. PCAO prosecutors continue to work to bring this case to trial, which is scheduled to begin in February of 2017.” 
Background: 
Since 2002, judges held all suspects charged with a Dangerous Crime Against Children, non-bondable. In 2002, Arizona voters passed an initiative that amended the Arizona Constitution, Article II Section 22 which prevented judges from setting bonds on any suspect charged with a DCAC. 
In June 2016, fourteen years after voters amended the Arizona Constitution, the Arizona Court of Appeals, Division I, used a 1987 U.S. Supreme Court case to overrule the 2002 voter amendment to the Constitution. This ruling means all DCAC suspects currently held non-bondable may request a hearing to seek bond by a judge. The new requirements force a judge to determine when ‘no conditions of release can reasonably assure the safety of the community or any person.’ This makes it essentially impossible to hold any DCAC suspect non-bondable. 
Shortly after the June ruling, the Maricopa County Attorney’s Office petitioned the Court of Appeals to overturn their ruling. The Court of Appeals denied that request and MCAO took the matter to the Arizona Supreme Court which granted the stay last week. 
Tyler Kost is presumed innocent, until and unless, proven guilty. Author: SanTanValley.com
