By: Richard MacDonald Studios, Inc. via PR Newswire August 12, 2016 at 01:42 AM EDT Richard MacDonald brings Spirit of the Olympics to Monterey with the installation of the Monumental Sculpture: &quot;The Flair&quot; 
MONTEREY, Calif. , Aug. 11, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Richard MacDonald (American, b.1946), internationally renowned figurative sculptor, has created an exact replica of his monumental sculpture, &quot;The Flair&quot; to be presented at the Richard MacDonald Studio at Ryan Ranch, Monterey . In this work the artist depicts the extraordinary tenacity and determination of humanity towards excellence, &quot;Triumph of the human spirit&quot;. Celebration of the 20 th Anniversary of Flair Across America and the Olympic Games in Atlanta: 8/16/16 Richard MacDonald Studios, Ryan Ranch, Monterey Refreshments and questions to the artist, 3-5pm 
In 1996 the original sculpture, &quot;The Flair&quot;, was a gift from the artist to the city of Atlanta and the Olympic athletes. The monument was exhibited with fanfare across the country with celebrations in San Francisco , Beverly Hills , Carmel , Laguna Beach , Dallas/Fort Worth, Michigan Avenue in Chicago , Central Park at the Plaza in New York City , and the museum Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C , before being permanently installed in the Georgia International Plaza, in Atlanta , for the Olympic Games. 
Representatives from the media are invited to the celebration hosted by the artist where they will have an opportunity to speak to the creator of the monumental Olympic sculpture, and hear the story of its conception and creation, as well as the historic nationwide tour that took place prior to its installation. This monument has since become an icon to the people of Atlanta and to many athletes around the world. Carmel was the only small city to see the unveiled monument, back in 1996, and to mark this anniversary a 26-foot-tall replica is being installed in Ryan Ranch. 
As interest in the spirit of the Olympics peaks with the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro this summer, the sculpture captures the commitment to excellence that makes the Olympics such an enduring spectacle. It is a tribute to athletes, but also in a broader sense, a tribute to all who strive and triumph.
