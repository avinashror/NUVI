Adrian Carambula, an Italian beach volleyball star, was called &apos;Mr. Skyball&apos; for his ridiculous volleyball serve that puts his adversary off-rhythm.   
According to Carambula, the skyball serve is what he uses to get people off their rhythm. He thinks it is part of his volleyball play because it is a different kind of serve and players do not usually train against it. For Carambula, the skyball serve is just a movement that comes naturally, according to Adrian Carambula in a video uploaded in International Volleyball Federation (FIVB)&apos;s Facebook page . 
&quot;It&apos;s just a movement that, for me, comes naturally. I just know that I want to put the ball up, I feel the wind, and then I let the ball and my body and everything come natural&quot;, Carambula stated. 
Adrian Carambula even embraced the nickname, &apos;Mr. Skyball&apos;. The volleyball star just loved being associated with the serve. He says that when he goes to a tournament, people do not call him &apos;Adrian&apos; anymore. He added that it is pretty cool thing when people call him &apos;Mr. Skyball&apos;, Business Insider reported. 
The Wall Street Journal noted that a Brazilian volleyball star also used a similar signature serve in the 1980s, however, Carambula does not think that he must be emulated. 
Mr. Skyball even gave tips on how to do extraordinary moves like the skyball serve. He stated that in order to do it, one must let the move come naturally and not imitating how he does it because it would not work. 
The serve would be a lot more common when Italy makes it to the finals of the beach volleyball in Rio 2016 Olympics. 
The effectiveness of this ridiculous serve may be doubted but it certainly is entertaining. 
There are videos in Twitter showing French volleyball players trying to do the skyball serve but fails. The caption even mentions that there is only one Mr. Skyball.
