J.O. Combs Receives Financial Reporting Awards Written by MaryLou Martinez on Mon, Aug 8 View Comments 
Congratulations to J.O. Combs Unified School District for receiving the Association of School Business Officials (ASBO) International’s Certificate of Excellence in Financial Reporting award. 
This award is conferred to school systems that have met or exceeded the programs high standards for financial reporting and accountability. The district was recognized for its Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for the fiscal year ending 2015. 
Additionally, the Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting was awarded to J.O. Combs by the Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA) of the United States and Canada for its comprehensive annual financial report (CAFR). The Certificate of Achievement is the highest form of recognition in the area of governmental accounting and financial reporting, and its attainment represents a significant accomplishment by a government and its management. 
The awards confirm the school business office’s commitment to financial accountability and transparency. 
The Association of School Business Officials International, founded in 1910, is a professional organization of 5,000 members that provides programs and services to promote the highest standards of school business management practices, professional growth, and the effective use of education resources. Whereas, the Government Finance Officers Association is a nonprofit professional association serving approximately 17,500 government finance professionals with offices in Chicago, IL, and Washington, D.C.
