Horowhenua gets four candidates in race for mayoralty NICHOLAS MCBRIDE Last updated 16:30, August 12 2016 FAITH SUTHERLAND 
Horowhenua district mayor Brendan Duffy will go for another term. 
Horowhenua is set for a mayoral race with the current mayor, a current councillor, a former mayoral candidate, and a man making his political debut all up for the top job. 
Sitting Horowhenua mayor Brendan Duffy is seeking another term but has been challenged by current Kere Kere ward councillor Michael Feyen, former Kere Kere councillor Anne Hunt, and new politico Matt Clark. 
Duffy said he was standing to &quot;continue the momentum we are already seeing&quot;. WARWICK SMITH/FAIRFAX NZ 
Michael Feyen is nominated for mayor but has not put his name in for council. 
&quot;I&apos;m standing to maintain the stability that this council and community are very comfortable and happy with.&quot; 
Duffy said he wanted to prepare for &quot;extraordinary growth&quot; predicted for the district. 
&quot;We have got a massive workload ahead of us.&quot; SUPPLIED/FAIRFAX NZ 
Anne Hunt is in the running for the mayoralty again. 
Duffy said he had built up a good relationship with central government agencies &quot;that is invaluable for communities like this&quot;. 
Feyen is also eyeing the mayoralty, but was not seeking a spot on council. 
​&quot;I&apos;m in or out. I will say what I think...there won&apos;t be sour grapes if I don&apos;t get in.&quot; Supplied 
Matt Clark, running for mayor in Horowhenua. Has never been involved with politics before. 
Feyen said there was a need for change in the district. Ad Feedback 
&quot;I&apos;m feeling pretty good about it. I have been in there for three years and seen no change. 
&quot;I&apos;m not negative. I don&apos;t like the system under which we operate. I don&apos;t think people get a fair shake.&quot; 
Feyen planned to address debt, Foxton water and infrastructure. 
Former councillor Hunt will make a run for the top job again after a failed attempt in 2013. 
Hunt said she made a last minute decision to stand, having seen how the Te Horowhenua Trust had been treated &quot;after all those years of loyal service&quot;. 
The trust was dissolved and its responsibilities absorbed by the council. 
Hunt said she wanted to address stormwater going into Lake Horowhenua, to which she claimed the council was a &quot;major polluter&quot;. 
New player Matt Clark, a rugby referee and former prenail plant operations manager, was making his first foray into politics. 
A self-described &quot;normal Joe Bloggs&quot;, Clarke said his motto was: &quot;People need to be heard&quot;. 
Clarke said he did not think the district was prepared enough for the State Highway 1 motorway improvements. 
&quot;Everyone is relying on the motorway, but we need to get infrastructure right for people here now.&quot; 
Clark planned to concentrate on infrastructure, including improving water at Foxton and Shannon. - Stuff
