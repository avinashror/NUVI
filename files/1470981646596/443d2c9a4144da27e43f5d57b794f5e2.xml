SUMMERTIME means sun (hopefully), fun and school holidays. 
It also means children in need of entertainment and — now we are well into August — let The Bolton News help you keep the kids from uttering those words: &apos;I&apos;m bored&apos;. 
Topping the list is Smithills Open Farm, set within 70 acres of rolling countryside a few miles north of Bolton town centre. 
Manager Carl Grimshaw said: &quot;We have lots of baby animals being born at the moment, such as cows, lambs, goats and piglets. 
&quot;We even have more exotic baby animals at the moment, including alpacas and meerkats. 
&quot;Last Sunday morning a baby llama was born, which does not happen often.&quot; 
Already popular with visitors thanks its family-friendly approach, there are exciting developments in the pipeline for the attraction. 
Mr Grimshaw added: &quot;A new building is being built on the farm we are hoping to have ready within six to eight weeks. 
&quot;The building project is part of two big developments we are doing to the farm. 
&quot;The new building will contain a robotic milking machine, allowing a better viewing area for visitors. 
&quot;The building will also house two separate pet corners for visitors to meet the baby animals.&quot; 
Listed below are 10 of the most popular family attractions in Bolton, according to TripAdvisor: 
1. Smithills Open Farm, Smithills Dean Road, Bolton 
4.5 rating from 551 reviews 
This family-run farm has a wide range of petting animals, from cows to horses and even stick insects. 
Besides animals there are plenty of other features to keep the children entertained, including a bouncy castle, an assault course and tractor tours. 
2. Octagon Theatre , Howell Croft South, Bolton 
4.5 rating from 202 reviews 
Situated in Bolton town centre, the Octagon is a well-established theatre that is renowned both locally and internationally for the dramatic arts. 
The theatre hosts plays, alongside cooking demonstrations, food festival events and youth projects. 
3. Fred Dibnah Heritage Centre, Radcliffe Road, Bolton 
4.5 rating from 141 reviews. 
Local hero, steeple jack and engineering enthusiast Fred Dibnah gained national fame in the 1978 BBC documentary ‘Fred Dibnah, Steeplejack’. 
Sadly Fred passed away in 2004. However his home and workshop, near Leverhulme Park, have been converted into a heritage centre commemorating Fred’s life. 
For Dibnah fans or visitors who have come from long distances, it is possible to stay in the Dibnah home for a couple of nights. 
4. Jumbles Country Park, Bradshaw Road 
4.5 rating from 208 reviews. 
Located in the Bradshaw Valley, the park opened in 1971 after the creation of the Jumbles Reservoir. 
The footpath around the reservoir is popular among walkers of all ages and is also used by cyclists, runners and hikers. 
A café and an information centre are also at the park. 
5. Bolton Central Library and Museum, Le Mans Crescent 
4.5 rating from 205 reviews 
Bolton Central Library and Museum is situated within the historic Le Mans Crescent area. 
The library holds the largest collection of works by legendary American poet, Walt Whitman, outside of the United States. 
The museum has a small but comprehensive collection of Ancient Egyptian artefacts. The textiles that belong to this collection are some of the oldest relics of their type in existence. 
6. Moses Gate Country Park, Hall Lane, Farnworth 
4 rating from 160 reviews 
The Farnworth park contains three lakes, the largest of which acts as a wildlife sanctuary, and multiple footpaths and bridleways for the more active among us. 
The play area, coupled with many places for picnics, makes Moses Park an ideal destination for families with young children. 
7. The Bolton Steam Museum , Mornington Road, Bolton 
5 rating from 64 reviews 
The museum is a must for anyone interested in local history or engineering. 
Founded by the Northern Mill Engine Society in 1960s, the museum strives to preserve our industrial past and contains one of the country’s largest collection of working mill steam engines. 
Entrance to the museum is free and donations are welcomed. 
8. Queens Park, Bolton 
4 rating from 99 reviews 
Situated just outside of the town centre, this Victorian park has been a recent recipient of a generous grant from the National Lottery Fund. 
The park is an ideal place to visit after a day out with the children in the town centre. 
9. Turton Tower, Chapeltown Road 
4 rating from 97 reviews 
Nestled in the leafy suburb of Edgworth, this 600-year-old manor is a Bolton landmark. The tower is home to a Victorian tea room, a walking group and much more. 
For those intrigued by the paranormal, Turton Tower also has its very own phantom, the Lady of Turton Tower, so keep an eye out when you visit. 
10. Party and Play Funhouse, Wingates Industrial Estate, Westhoughton 
4 rating from 45 reviews 
Open every day of the week, the funhouse is a great place for the kids to play. 
The funhouse has various activities both indoors and outdoors for different age groups, including a trampoline and a sandpit. 
There is a café on-site and bookings are welcome.
