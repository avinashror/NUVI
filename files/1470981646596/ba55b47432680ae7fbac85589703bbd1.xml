Excitement at light speed hits fans as Lucas Films release the &quot;Rouge One: A Star Wars Story&quot; teaser for its second trailer is released on August 10, 2016.   
A team consisting of a rebel, pilot, assassin, warrior and most especially a droid are what fans will see in the teaser and more of it on August 11, 2016 where the trailer will be released during NBC coverage of the 2016 Rio Olympics a perfect stage to ramp up promotions and solidify the film as a worthy addition to the franchise. A critical point of Lucas Films promotion of the anticipated movie with only four months until its release, even in this teaser it is clear that the Lucas Films is not holding back, Screen Rant reported. 
The first standalone film in the Star Wars franchise. The premise set between the prequels and the original trilogy the film focuses on the team of ordinary beings banded together to do the extraordinary; a mission to steal the plans for the original death star which points us that it is closer to the original trilogy thus it will feature familiar faces including the confirmed appearance of Darth Vader. Aside from the new characters that the film will focus on, glimpse of new locations, and vivid visuals, Cleveland.com reported. 
Coined as A Star Wars story in the large universe of the Star Wars franchise, this film is interesting enough as it features no Jedis or the use of the force within its main cast but still worthy to be part of the beloved franchise. As the second trailer premiers on August 11, 2016. Advertisement 
This teaser delivers enough momentum for fans to wait for the release. With Gareth Edwards handling the direction of the film together with Felicity Jones, Diego Luna , Ben Mendelsohn, Donnie Yen , mads Mikkelsen, Alan Tudyk, Riz Ahmed, with Jiang Wen and Forest Whitaker, taking on new roles for the franchise to bloom.
