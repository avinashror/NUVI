DALLAS - After waiting a year to get to the top of the waiting list for a new liver, a woman made an incredible sacrifice for a stranger, one that doctors said they&apos;d never seen before. 
Brenda Jones, 69, opted to put herself back on the waiting list for a liver transplant in order to save the life of another woman who had a more urgent need. Doctors believed that Abigail Flores, 23, had at most 24 hours to live if she didn&apos;t get a new liver. 
“The judgment behind it seemed very clear, but it still felt unorthodox nonetheless,” said Dr. Greg McKenna, a Baylor Hospital surgeon. 
The liver was a match for both women. Jones said it was easy for her to make the decision to give the liver to Flores. 
“In my heart, I wouldn’t have been able to live with the liver if I had let this little girl die,&quot; Jones said. &quot;And I still had more time ... I would have been a very selfish person.&quot; 
Jones was able to get a liver transplant a few days later. Both women are now recovering from their transplant surgeries. 
&quot;If it wasn’t for her, I wouldn’t be sitting right here right now,&quot; Flores said. &quot;I thank God for her each and every day.&quot;
