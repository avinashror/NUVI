WFU Adding Stadium-Wide Alcohol Sales this Fall By Cristen DrummondThursday, August 11, 2016 at 10:19 PM EDT 
WINSTON-SALEM -- Wake Forest University scores a touchdown Thursday among some sport fans. 
The school announced it will have beer and wine sales stadium-wide at football and basketball games beginning this Fall. 
“That&apos;s really exciting,” Demon Deacon fan Joshua Talley said. “Fun for everybody.&quot; 
The university is the first Division I school in the state to allow this type of sale at football games. 
Previous years, alcohol beverages were only available in select areas around BB&amp;T Field and the Lawrence Joel Memorial Coliseum. WFU consulted other universities and learned stadium-wide sales may be better for an overall fan experience. 
&quot;The behavior actually improved during the games,” athletic director, Ron Wellman said. “Fans weren&apos;t drinking too much in the parking lot knowing that they can get beer and wine in the stadium.&quot; 
Wake Forest is considering adding alcohol sales at other campus stadiums including baseball and soccer. 
The football team opens its 2016 season at BB&amp;T Field on September 1 against Tulane.
