Tenth Street, along with some nearby side streets, will close at 2 p.m. Tuesday for the occasion. . Ashley Goettig, chamber administrative assistant, said the event is fun for all. “I think it is a really important event,” she said. “It draws the community together and gives a reason to get out and have a good time.” Amanda Walljasper-Tate, retail committee chairperson, said Cruisin’ Downtown Worthington is a special event for the city. “This is a really fun event and it has definitely grown over the years,” said Walljasper-Tate.
