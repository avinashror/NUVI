A former Vol&apos;s Olympic journey begins on Friday, when the track and field events get underway. 
Tavis Bailey first picked up a discus in the seventh grade. 
&quot;I actualyl went out for track because my mom wanted me to run the mile and lose some weight because I was overweight in middle school,&quot; he said. 
As soon as the coaches saw him, they sent him over to the throwing area. 
Tavis liked it because it was better than going home after school. 
&quot;It just kind of started in middle school, just hanging out with my friends, doing something else that was not me being at home doing chores,&quot; said Tavis. 
He was good at football too. He played offensive line his freshman year at Lenoir-Rhyne before transferring to Tennessee. There, throwing was the focus. Bailey was the national runner-up in discus in 2015. With a degree in hand, he focused on Rio. 
&quot;A lot of throwers that have gotten out of it will say if its an Olympic year and its your first year out of college, you&apos;re in the best shape of your life, just give it your all and see where it will take you. People say they stopped too early so going into this year my whole entire goal was to give it my all so at the end of the day if I don&apos;t make the team I know I gave it everything I had,&quot; he said. 
On a rainy July day in Oregon, Bailey finished second at the U.S. Trials and made the team. 
&quot;Everyone starts going crazy when we stepped onto the track for the victory lap, that&apos;s when it started sinking in, wow I just made the Olympic team and then all the workouts that you put in and all the late night sessions then all just start being worth every second.&quot; 
Track isn&apos;t Bailey&apos;s only focus. He has a real job--- selling hotel signs for Cummings Resources. 
&quot;I actually kind of enjoy it, it brings another dimension to my life outside of track and outside of being an athlete,&quot; he said. &quot;When the track career is just a grind day to day, I&apos;m still winning properties at work everyday. It&apos;s just something else that&apos;s going really, really well for me so if I have a bad practice instead of me stressing about the practice, I&apos;ll go to work and just focus on work for the day and let the practice slip out of my mind.&quot; 
Tavis is grateful for the support of his parents and friends.. It&apos;s vital when the days are this long. 
&quot;When you find yourself in a weight room at 10:30, 11:00 kind of consistently, just having someone else in there, just another presence there, makes it a lot easier.&quot; 
Tavis trains with Stephen Mozia, a Cornell grad who throws shot put for Nigeria. John Newell coaches them and they all made it to Rio. 
&quot;We call ourselves the runner-up track and field club,&quot; he laughed. 
Tavis competes in the qualifications Friday morning at 8:30. You can watch them live here . If he makes it through, the competition will continue on Saturday.
