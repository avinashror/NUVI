CHICAGO (AP) — The St. Louis Cardinals&apos; playoff hopes took a big hit thanks to a costly hit by pitch.
Matt Holliday was lost to a broken right thumb after he was plunked by a 94 mph fastball in St. Louis&apos; 4-3, 11-inning loss to the Chicago Cubs on Thursday night.
Reliever Mike Montgomery (4-5) hit the seven-time All-Star on a 1-1 count with two outs and nobody on in the 10th.
An X-ray showed the fracture. Holliday declined to speculate if his season is over.
&quot;Yeah for sure it&apos;s super disappointing,&quot; Holliday said, &quot;but it&apos;s part of the sport, unfortunately.&quot;
St. Louis fell 13 games behind the Cubs in the NL Central but is a half-game out of the final wild-card spot.
&quot;We&apos;ve got some young talented players that are going to have to step up and get the job done,&quot; Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said. &quot;That&apos;s all there is to it. There is going to be some opportunity for them now.&quot;
Holliday, who left for a pinch-runner after being checked by the trainer, had singled and scored in the first inning. He&apos;s hitting .242 with 19 home runs and 60 RBIs.
&quot;I definitely feel for him,&quot; Montgomery said. &quot;It wasn&apos;t on purpose. It&apos;s just one of those pitches that&apos;s a big part of the game, going inside, and it just got away.&quot;
Anthony Rizzo drew a bases-loaded, two-out walk from Zach Duke to give the Cubs their 10th straight victory.
Pinch-hitters Willson Contreras and Jorge Soler led off with singles against the lefty Duke (2-1) and Dexter Fowler walked to load the bases with one out. Kris Bryant struck out before Rizzo, who crowds the plate, took a 3-1 pitch inside to give the Cubs their longest winning streak since 12 straight in 2001.
&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; Duke said when asked if he thought it was a ball. &quot;I can only speak for myself. It&apos;s a tough call to not get right there.&quot;
Randal Grichuk, called up from the minors before the game, tied it for St. Louis with a pinch-hit solo home run off Travis Wood in the seventh. Brandon Moss also homered for St. Louis.
Chris Coghlan had a two-run single and David Ross an RBI bunt single in the sixth for the Cubs.
Both managers used their closers in the ninth. Chicago&apos;s Aroldis Chapman needed three pitches to get two liners to third and a groundout, while Seung Hwan Oh struck out the side for St. Louis. Oh then worked out of a 10th-inning jam.
Cubs lefty Jon Lester allowed two runs and five hits with six strikeouts in six innings, but lost a chance at his 13th win when Grichuk sent a 1-0 cutter into the left-field bleachers.
Moss hit his first homer off a lefty this season in the sixth to put the Cardinals up 2-0. Yadier Molina added three hits, including an RBI single in the first to extend his on-base streak to 24 games.
Martinez allowed three runs and seven hits over six innings. He hurt himself when he cut off a throw home that seemingly had a chance to get Anthony Rizzo on Chicago&apos;s second run.
Holliday was to see a hand specialist Friday and then return to St. Louis.
&quot;Trying to make the playoffs, you lose your three-hole hitter, one of the leaders of the team, it&apos;s pretty tough,&quot; Grichuk said. &quot;We&apos;ve just got to regroup and get everybody to pull together.&quot;
TRAINER&apos;S ROOM
Cardinals: A day after being scratched, 1B Matt Adams (shoulder) was placed on the 15-day disabled list. &quot;He&apos;s been working on some things throwing and also with his swing and something didn&apos;t respond well,&quot; Matheny said. Grichuk was recalled from Triple-A Memphis.
WEAVER PROMOTION
The Cardinals plan to promote RHP Luke Weaver, one of their top prospects, to start Saturday at Wrigley Field. The 2014 first-round pick will replace Michael Wacha (shoulder).
&quot;You want to sometimes throw them in there and see how they answer the call coming here in a tough environment,&quot; Matheny said. &quot;Some guys rise to that occasion, so I&apos;m excited to watch him pitch.&quot;
UP NEXT
Cubs RHP Jake Arrieta (13-5, 2.59 ERA) faces RHP Adam Wainwright (9-6, 4.34) on Friday afternoon.
