Ormiston boss Richie Weir hopes he won’t have to pick himself . Have your say 
Ormiston manager Richie Weir is hoping he has big enough pool of players to choose from for tomorrow’s Football Nation Qualifying Cup clash with Stirling University – just so he doesn’t have to list himself as a substitute. 
Weir is just a couple of months into his new role, having taken over from predecessor Brian Johnston after he moved on to pastures new with Haddington Athletic. 
However, he has found himself stripped and ready for action during the club’s opening two League Cup defeats to Peebles Rovers and Lothian Thistle Hutchison Vale, but isn’t receptive to the prospect of a third outing at Recreation Park tomorrow. 
Speaking ahead of his side’s clash with Lowland League opposition, Weir said: “I’m really hoping I don’t have to go on the bench again or even find myself starting for that matter. But we are struggling again with numbers as we’ve got a few injured and others on holiday, so fingers crossed we don’t have any more call-offs. 
“I had one of our players cancel at 12.30 last Saturday before our match with Lothian and that just isn’t ideal when you’ve worked on preparing your team throughout the week. But these things can’t be helped and it’s just something you’ve got to deal with at the time.” 
Tomorrow’s clash in East Lothian will allow Weir and his players some respite from what has been a disappointing start to the campaign. The club are currently bottom of League Cup Group B, having lost their opening two matches. 
“We’re treating the League Cup as our pre-season really but we’ll certainly be looking to make an impact in the Qualifying Cup, that’s for sure,” he said. 
“I’ve told the guys to erase the 5-0 defeat to Lothian last week from their minds and just focus on the games that lie ahead. There’s no pressure on us tomorrow so I’ve just told them to go out and enjoy it. We’re not expected to get a result, so it might just be one where we can spring a surprise. 
“The league is our bread and butter this year and that’s what we are all building towards.” 
Elsewhere, Banji Koya takes his Heriot-Watt University side to Innerleithen where Vale of Leithen are the hosts for their Football Nation Qualifying Cup first-round encounter. 
The Riccarton-based outfit have fared fine in their two outings this season, a 2-0 win over Tynecastle in League Cup Group B before going down by the same scoreline to Leith Athletic. Sign in
