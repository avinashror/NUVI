Viral video with Tampa ties boosts organ donation Viral video encourages organ donations Eric Glasser , WTSP 6:27 PM. EST August 11, 2016 The video is called &quot;Coleman Sweeney the World&apos;s Biggest A*- hole.&quot; It’s nearly three minutes of bad behavior, honking at the handicapped, corrupting kids and worse. YouTube 
Tampa, FL -- Have you seen it yet? A viral video with Tampa ties aimed at millennials encourages them to become organ donors. 
The ad campaign&apos;s crude humor is already having a serious impact. 
It is shocking, crass, and by far the most successful ad campaign ever for Donate Life America. 
The video is called &quot;Coleman Sweeney the World&apos;s Biggest A*- hole.&quot; It’s nearly three minutes of bad behavior, honking at the handicapped, corrupting kids and worse. 
But then, Sweeney dies from a brain aneurysm. 
In his pocket? An organ donor card. 
The music and mood changes. 
Sweeney’s liver saves a father. His heart saves a teacher. Tendons help a wounded soldier walk again 
Coleman Sweeney, World’s Biggest – you know what – is a hero. 
“We let them run with it,” said Jason Woody, president of Tampa&apos;s Lions Eye Institute and chairman of Donate Life America. 
Woody was referring to the Martin Agency, the same name behind those clever Geico ads. Martin donated the $1 million project. 
And since their controversial ad campaign started organ donation registration is up -- 600% in some categories in just the first week. 
It’s why despite criticism of the crudeness, Woody is unapologetic. Citing the 22 people who die each day – waiting for an organ donation. 
“You know, if I offend half a dozen people during this campaign but I save one person’s life we&apos;ve done our job. 
The ad, which is edgy, irreverent and humorous is aimed at millennials. A hard to reach age group for organ donation. 
So far it’s been social media gold. 
“I like the message,” said Kat Klein, 21. “It was kind of funny, but at the same time it was serious.” 
“If it&apos;s boring, no one, at least my age, will watch it,” added Samantha Bauer, 17. “It has to be funny and has to have something that will reel us in.” 
With 50 million views and counting this campaign may be hard to top, but Woody says they are working on more of them and even an app for the IPhone’s iOS 10, which would put the power of organ donation in the palm of young potential donors’ hands. 
The ad campaign has apparently been a big hit with men also. 
Usually, says Woody, women outnumber men 60-40% when it comes to organ donation registration. 
But since the video went viral, men have made up almost 70% of new registrations.
