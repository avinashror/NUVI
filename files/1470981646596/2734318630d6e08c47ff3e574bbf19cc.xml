A 14-bed, $35 million expansion has been planned for Sentara Princess Anne Hospital in Virginia Beach. 
Sentara says the expansion will add 14 medical or surgical inpatient beds to the hospital. It would add two stories on top of an existing patient tower. 
The hospital says it has applied to the Virginia Department of Health for a Certificate of Public Need for the expansion. 
Nine of the planned 14 beds would come from other Sentara Hospitals, with the remaining five coming from Bon Secours DePaul Medical Center in Norfolk. 
The planned expansion would raise the number of beds at the hospital to 174, Sentara says.
