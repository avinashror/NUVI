External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj shared this adorable picture of her and her husband, Swaraj Kaushal, on Twitter on Thursday. (Photo: ANI) New Delhi : Sushma Swaraj looks to have become the most loved minister of the Bharatiya Janata Party government. She surprised her followers on Twitter when she shared a cheerful picture of her and her husband Swaraj Kaushal on the social media platform on Thursday.
The External Affairs Minister bumped into her husband in Parliament complex after “many years” and later shared the adorable picture, in which the couple is seen holding hands, on Twitter.
“Together after many years – a chance meeting with @governorswaraj at the Parliament House gate today,” she tweeted with the photo, in which Congress leader Digvijaya Singh can be seen standing behind Kaushal, smiling at the couple.

— Sushma Swaraj (@SushmaSwaraj) August 11, 2016 Response to her tweet started pouring in soon after, with one of them apologetically asking the minister if the couple was not together anymore.
To which, Sushma replied “घर में साथ हैं. संसद में नहीं हैं. (We are together at home, not in the Parliament.)”
“He was a member of Rajya Sabha from 1998-2004. I was in Lok Sabha. Then I came to Rajya Sabha in 2000. We were in Rajya Sabha together from 2000 -2004,” she said in a couple of tweets.
@SushmaSwaraj पूछना तो नहीं बनता फिर भी...उचित समझें तो उत्तर लिख दें क्या आप,अब साथ नहीं हैं?
— Raksha Singh (@raksha24760) August 11, 2016 Kaushal is not a parliamentarian anymore. He is a senior advocate and a criminal lawyer in the Supreme Court.
