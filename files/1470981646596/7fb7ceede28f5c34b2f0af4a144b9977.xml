The security forces used biometric systems during search operation to catch the terror suspects. Personnel of counter terrorism department arrested banned outfit leader Izzatullah from Sialkot. 
After the deadly Quetta blast that claimed over 70 lives, Chief of Army Staff General Raheel Sharif had ordered intelligence agencies to carry out combing operations across the country in a bid to enhance offensive against terrorists. 
“The terror strike in Quetta was an attempt by anti-state forces to sabotage China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)”, he said. 
The army chief said intelligence agencies could go anywhere in the country to catch suspects linked with the terror attacks. Facebook Comments
