USF: Stress makes birds mosquito targets Courtney Robinson , WTSP 9:06 PM. EST August 11, 2016 “Whether stress will make you more likely to get bit by mosquito, I don&apos;t know. But, it&apos;s quite reasonable. We have the same hormone and it has very similar effects in us,” said lead investigator Dr. Lynn Martin. WTSP photo CONNECT TWEET PINTEREST 
Tampa, FL - If you think you’re a mosquito magnet, be glad you don’t have wings. University of South Florida researchers say the more stressed out a bird is, the more likely it is to be a mosquito target. 
USF researchers spent the past few years studying how stress affects birds, their interaction with mosquitoes and spreading the mosquito-borne West Nile Virus. 
The West Nile Virus can cause brain and spinal infections and has led to the deaths of 1,700 Americans since 1999. 
Researchers injected songbirds with a stress hormone to mimic environmental stress levels caused by things like light, noise, pesticides and other pollution. They then let mosquitoes feed on birds. Their data shows that birds with high levels of the stress hormone were twice as likely to be bit even though the same birds were more aggressive at trying to defend against mosquito bites. 
“Whether stress will make you more likely to get bit by mosquito, I don&apos;t know. But, it&apos;s quite reasonable. We have the same hormone and it has very similar effects in us,” said lead investigator Dr. Lynn Martin. 
Martin says stress also makes it harder for songbirds to fight off the West Nile Virus. He says stress creates the perfect storm because it allows the virus to stay in the bird and spread to mosquitoes because stressed birds are bit more. 
Martin and his team also looked at mosquitoes after they fed on birds with higher stress levels. They say those mosquitoes laid fewer eggs. 
“The one thing we don&apos;t know yet is how the mosquitoes know to choose these birds,” said Martin. 
Martin says the biggest takeaway from this study is showing that human impact on the environment cannot only impact wildlife, but people, too. 
“In the case of West Nile, something that infects us, we run the risk of not only affecting the population of birds, we run the risk of influencing ourselves,” he said. 
As for whether this study has any implication for the Zika virus, Martin said the jury is still out. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that birds do not carry Zika.
