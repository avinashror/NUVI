A HIT-and-run victim&apos;s employer has urged people to help track down the driver who knocked him down and left him for dead. 
Jakub Nawa?ka, aged 25, was hit by a blue Toyota Celica outside the Co-op in Tonge Moor Road, Tonge Moor, on Tuesday at 8.50pm. He is in Salford Royal Hospital in a serious condition. 
Mr Nawalka, of Eldon Street, Tonge Moor, works in a warehouse on Britannia Way, The Valley for Designer Habitat, a Manchester-based homeware and electrical goods retailer. A spokesman for the firm said: “After a member of our team was seriously injured during a hit and run incident on Tuesday evening, we’re urging anyone with information to contact GMP’s Serious Collision Investigation Unit on 0161 856 4745 or 101 quoting 2204 of 09/08/16 or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111. Our thoughts are with his friends and family at this difficult time.” 
Mr Nawalka was crossing Tonge Moor Road when the Toyota, heading in the direction of Bolton town centre, knocked him into the air. 
Witnesses say the Toyota driver was visibly &quot;impatient&quot; and the collision happened while he was overtaking a slower car in front and was remonstrating with that vehicle&apos;s driver as he passed. 
Mr Nawalka, from Krakow in Poland, was taken to hospital with unspecified critical injuries and his shocked friends and relatives, as well as girlfriend, are rallying round. 
Friends said there was no update on his condition as yet and declined to comment further.
