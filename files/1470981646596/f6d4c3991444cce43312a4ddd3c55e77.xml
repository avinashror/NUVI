ST. PETERSBURG, FL -- It&apos;s an invisible danger. 
But, a natural gas leak can be detected. The deadly explosion at the apartment complex in Silver Spring, Maryland, is a tragic reminder of how important it is to know the warning signs. 
&quot;A leak can happen below ground or above ground,&quot; said Lieutenant Steven Lawrence with St. Petersburg Fire Rescue. 
&quot;That gas when it finds an ignition source, then it all of a sudden ignites and it ignites with an explosion. Lt. Steven Lawrence with St. Petersburg Fire Rescue said if you smell something rotten, it might not be the trash. 
&quot;The manufacturers have to add an odor, it&apos;s called Mercaptan. It&apos;s a sulfur smell. If you&apos;ve smelled rotten eggs, that sulfur, that&apos;s what the odors going to smell like,&quot; he said. 
&quot;Evacuate the structure, call 911, have us come out and do the monitoring.&quot; You can also buy a combustible gas detector for your home. It won&apos;t detect the amount of natural gas in the air, but it will warn you of a problem. 
&quot;You&apos;ll have a constant click, it&apos;s kind of like a metronome. It&apos;ll constantly click and then as you get closer to a flammable substance, it&apos;ll start to click faster and faster and then eventually go into a full alarm.&quot; If you do smell that odor or for some reason suspect a natural gas leak in your home, you have to act fast because it can quickly displace oxygen from your home and even cause an explosion like what happened in Maryland.
